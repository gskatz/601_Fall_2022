The survey was administered to registered voters across all 150 Federal Electoral Divisions in Australian states/territories . Respondents recieved one question to which an answer was either yes, no or response not clear.\n\n## Tidy Data (as needed)\n\nIs your data already tidy, or is there work to be done? Be sure to anticipate your end result to provide a sanity check, and document your work here.\n\nAs seen below, the data is tidy and only contains 16 observations of 4 variables (16 x 4).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in object[[i]]: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAre there any variables that require mutation to be usable in your analysis stream? For example, do you need to calculate new values in order to graph them? Can string values be represented numerically? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nDocument your work here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Pivoting responses to be independent variables\ndf <- df %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = resp, values_from = c(percent,count)) %>% \n  mutate(`Total responses`= (`count_yes` + `count_no`))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in UseMethod(\"pivot_wider\"): no applicable method for 'pivot_wider' applied to an object of class \"function\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Recoding names of the Australian Territories\ndf$territory <-  recode(df$territory, `New South Wales`= \"NSW\", `Northern Territory(b)` = \"N.

I also arranged the Territories (x-axis) by disapproval percentage in descending order. This allows me to see if any patterns exists among less/more populated areas.\n\n## Bivariate Visualization(s)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Co-relation between Approval percentage and Number of respondents\nggplot(df, aes(x =`percent_no`, y= `Total responses`, colour=territory )) +\ngeom_point() +\ngeom_smooth(color= 'blue',method='lm', formula= y~x)+\nlabs(x= \" Disapproval %\", y= \"Number of Respondents\", color= \"Territory\" )+\nggtitle(\"Graph 1.3: Total Respondents vs Disapproval %\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in `ggplot()`:\n! `data` cannot be a function.\nℹ Have you misspelled the `data` argument in `ggplot()`\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGraph 1.3 further explorers the correlation between population and approval percentages. This graph is **very trivial** because there are only eight (8) Australian territories which is **insufficient to establish a pattern. \\[Only done for practice\\].**\n\nTherefore, no true pattern exists by respondent count but perhaps geographically. It would be interesting to see if these results differ regionally. i.e Are more rural areas more likely to approve/disapprove.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  #Approval of same-sex marriage by Australian Territory\nggplot(df, aes(x =reorder(territory,percent_no) , y = `percent_yes`, fill = factor(percent_no))) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(x= \" Austrailian Territory\", y= \"Approval % of Same-Sex Marriage\", fill= \"Disapproval %\" ) +\nggtitle(\"Graph 1.4: Total Respondents vs Disapproval %\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in `ggplot()`:\n! `data` cannot be a function.\nℹ Have you misspelled the `data` argument in `ggplot()`\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGraph 1.4 ranks the Australian territories in descending order of approval %.\n\nI chose a bar graph for simplicity. Although, not necessary for this analysis, I included the disapproval % as a factor in the legend. I want the reader to understands the binary relationship between yes/no responses as both sum to 100%, i.e any unclear responses were not included in the tidy data.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\n**According to the data, the majority of Australians, who participated in the Nov 2017 postal survey, approve of same-sex marriage.**\n",
