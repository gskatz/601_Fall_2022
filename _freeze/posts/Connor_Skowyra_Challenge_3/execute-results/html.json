We will using the column names of IPCC.Area, Farm Animal and Weight Per Animal equaling three columns.\n\n9*16=144\n\n## Pivot the Data\n\nDocument your work here.\n\nanimal_weight_longer<-pivot_longer(animal_weight, \ncol=-`IPCC.Area`,\nnames_to = \"Farm Animal,\nvalues_to = \"Weight Per Animal\")\n> animal_weight_longer\n\nInputting this Pivot allows you to see the weight and kind of farm animal related to each specific region. We will also be able to confirm that the animal_weight_longer has 144 rows and 3 columns confirming the tidying process.\n",
