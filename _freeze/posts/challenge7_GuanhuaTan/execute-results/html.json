So I decided to narrow my reach here to five countries. I'd like to look at schools responses regarding a set of questions \"SC155\". SC155 surveys the accessibility to digital devices and its related training as well as assistance. I clean the data and group_by data as regional code. So I make two different datasets at first. One includes all identifier information. The other covers the columns that contains \"SC155Q\". Then, I use function \"cbind\" to combine these two into a new dataset (pisa2018_joint). Furthermore, I found that the questions from SC155Q01HA to SC155Q01HA focus on the accessibility to digital devices while the questions from SC155Q05HA to SC155Q11HA stress on if the schools offer enough traibing, support, and incentives. I mutate two new variables--\"Accessibility\" and \"Human_Resource_Support that respectively calculate the average of the former and the latter. Besides, I calculate every country average for \"Accessibility\" and \"Human_Resource_Support.\" After tidying data, the dataset has four columns and 80 rows.\n\n## Visualization with Multiple Dimensions\n\n### Painting World\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# further tidy data and pivot_longer\n# world difference in general\n\npisa2018_clean_pivot<-pisa2018_joint_clean %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols=c(Accessibility_Country_Ave, Human_Resource_ave), \n               names_to = \"Group\", values_to = \"Evaluation\")\npisa2018_clean_pivot %>%\n   ggplot(aes(Evaluation, fill=Group))+\n  stat_boxplot(geom = \"errorbar\", # Error bars\n               width = 0.1)+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  facet_wrap(~Group+OECD_or_Non_OECD)+\n  labs(title=\"Pisa2018 Digital Divce Evaluation\")+\n  coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](challenge7_GuanhuaTan_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nIn order to further tidy data, I first used pivot_longer to create two new variables \"Group\" and \"Evaluation\".I put the original variables--\"Accessibility_Country_Ave\" and \"Human_Resource_ave\" names to the \"Group\" and values to \"Evaluation.\" After cleaning and rearranging the dataset, I create four graphics.\nThe box plot enjoys the reputation for clearly showing the distribution of a group of numbers, which allows me to disclose the distribution and general situation of every country's evaluation on digital devices.The boxplot graphics reveal that the OECD countries enjoy the higher access to digital devices than non-OECD countries. But these two groups have reported that their human resource evaluations are in the similar range. The latter reflects the limits to this survey's methodology. Because this survey is reliance on schools' self-report. There is no any objective measurements for them to measure their access to and human resources support on digital devices. Therefore, instead of reflecting that OECD countries lack human resources support, the data may show OECD and non-OECD countries have distinct expectations on human resources support. So self-report can only demonstrate the gap between their expectations and current situations.\n\n\n\n### A Case Study of Six Countires\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# tidy data about the case study\n# choose five countries to look at regional difference within the countries\n# United Kingdom (GBR), Hong Kong (HKG), Philippines (PHL), Argentina (ARG), Brazil(BRA), France(FRA)\npisa2018_joint_case_study <- pisa2018_joint  %>%\n  select(CNT, STRATUM, OECD, SC155Q01HA,SC155Q02HA, SC155Q03HA, SC155Q04HA, SC155Q05HA,\n         SC155Q06HA, SC155Q07HA, SC155Q08HA, SC155Q09HA, SC155Q10HA, SC155Q11HA) %>%\n  group_by(STRATUM) %>%\n  arrange(STRATUM) %>%\n  filter(CNT== \"GBR\" | CNT== \"HKG\" | CNT==\"PHL\"| CNT==\"ARG\" | CNT==\"BRA\" |CNT==\"FRA\" )\npisa2018_joint_case_study\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2,114 × 14\n# Groups:   STRATUM [129]\n   CNT   STRATUM  OECD SC155Q0…¹ SC155…² SC155…³ SC155…⁴ SC155…⁵ SC155…⁶ SC155…⁷\n   <chr> <chr>   <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 ARG   ARG0101     0         1       1       1       1       1       2       2\n 2 ARG   ARG0101     0        NA      NA      NA      NA      NA      NA      NA\n 3 ARG   ARG0101     0         2       1       2       2       2       2       2\n 4 ARG   ARG0101     0         2       1       2       3       2       2       1\n 5 ARG   ARG0101     0         1       1       2       2       2       2       2\n 6 ARG   ARG0101     0         3       2       3       2       2       2       1\n 7 ARG   ARG0101     0         1       1       1       1       1       3       1\n 8 ARG   ARG0101     0         1       1       1       1       1       1       1\n 9 ARG   ARG0101     0        NA      NA      NA      NA      NA      NA      NA\n10 ARG   ARG0101     0         1       1       1       1       2       2       2\n# … with 2,104 more rows, 4 more variables: SC155Q08HA <dbl>, SC155Q09HA <dbl>,\n#   SC155Q10HA <dbl>, SC155Q11HA <dbl>, and abbreviated variable names\n#   ¹​SC155Q01HA, ²​SC155Q02HA, ³​SC155Q03HA, ⁴​SC155Q04HA, ⁵​SC155Q05HA,\n#   ⁶​SC155Q06HA, ⁷​SC155Q07HA\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#further tidy data\n\npisa2018_joint_case_study$Accessibility=rowMeans(pisa2018_joint_case_study[,c(\"SC155Q01HA\",\"SC155Q02HA\", \"SC155Q03HA\",\"SC155Q04HA\")])\npisa2018_joint_case_study$Human_Resource_Support=rowMeans(pisa2018_joint_case_study[,c(\"SC155Q05HA\",\"SC155Q06HA\", \"SC155Q07HA\",\"SC155Q08HA\",\"SC155Q09HA\", \"SC155Q10HA\", \"SC155Q11HA\")])\npisa2018_case_study_clean <- pisa2018_joint_case_study %>%\n  select(CNT,STRATUM,OECD, Accessibility, Human_Resource_Support) %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols=c(Accessibility, Human_Resource_Support), names_to = \"Group\", values_to = \"Evaluation\")%>%\n   mutate(OECD_or_Non_OECD =case_when(\n    OECD==0~\"Non-OECD\",\n    OECD==1~\"OECD\")) %>%\n  select(-OECD)\npisa2018_case_study_clean\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 4,228 × 5\n# Groups:   STRATUM [129]\n   CNT   STRATUM Group                  Evaluation OECD_or_Non_OECD\n   <chr> <chr>   <chr>                       <dbl> <chr>           \n 1 ARG   ARG0101 Accessibility                1    Non-OECD        \n 2 ARG   ARG0101 Human_Resource_Support       1.57 Non-OECD        \n 3 ARG   ARG0101 Accessibility               NA    Non-OECD        \n 4 ARG   ARG0101 Human_Resource_Support      NA    Non-OECD        \n 5 ARG   ARG0101 Accessibility                1.75 Non-OECD        \n 6 ARG   ARG0101 Human_Resource_Support       2.29 Non-OECD        \n 7 ARG   ARG0101 Accessibility                2    Non-OECD        \n 8 ARG   ARG0101 Human_Resource_Support       1.43 Non-OECD        \n 9 ARG   ARG0101 Accessibility                1.5  Non-OECD        \n10 ARG   ARG0101 Human_Resource_Support       1.86 Non-OECD        \n# … with 4,218 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nBesides the general situation around the world.
