My goal was to manipulate the data into a workable form in which I could explore and analyze a research question for the data I had available to me. I did this by using several mutates in order to give the need columns, variables and instances.\n\nFrom this data I was able to interpret that there are 6741 instances of 12 variables, meaning these current products are on the Sales Floor Room, Quarantine room, or vault.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nCurrent_Inventory <- read_csv(\"../posts/2022-11-16 Export inventory.csv\",\n                                         skip = 1,\n                                         col_names = c(\"delete\",\"product\",\"package ID\",\"batch\",\"available\",\"room\",\"price\",\"cost\",\"category\",\"expiration_date\",\"thc\",\"isCannabis\"))%>%\n  select(!contains(\"delete\"))%>%\n  separate(col = \"thc\", into = c(\"thc\",\"unit_thc (%/mg)\"), sep = \" \")%>%\n  mutate(thc = as.numeric(thc),\n        isCannabis = case_when(\n           isCannabis == \"Yes\" ~ TRUE,\n           isCannabis == \"No\" ~ FALSE\n         ))%>%\n  mutate(expiration_date = na_if(expiration_date, \"Invalid date\"),\n         expiration_date = mdy(expiration_date))%>%\n  mutate(\n    date = as.Date(expiration_date),\n    day = day(expiration_date))%>%\n  mutate(\n    format_date = format(date, \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n  )%>%\n  arrange(desc(room), category, product)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: '../posts/2022-11-16 Export inventory.csv' does not exist in current working directory ('C:/Users/micha/OneDrive/Documents/Graduate School/DACSS 601/601_Fall_2022/posts/Homework 3').\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Homework Three\n\n## Cleaning Current Inventory\n\nHere I am reading in the Lab results from the current inventory across 3 License, Worcester Adult Use and Medical, and Northampton Adult Use. The most commonly recognized cannabinoids are THC, CBD, CBG, CBN, and CBC, others usually are present in negligible amounts or are sub variation such as THCa or CBDa. For the purposes of this project I have only included the main cannabinoids and their active sub variation which is noted with an (a) at the end of the abbreviation, as those are the most common in the products we sell.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nCurrentInvAllLicense_orig <- read_xlsx(\"../Homework 3/Current Inventory Lab Results Report 11_29_2022-12_6_2022.xlsx\",\n                                         skip = 4,\n                                         col_names = c(\"license\",\"room\",\"product\",\"category\",\"package id\",\"delete\",\"delete1\", \"batch\",\"cbd\",\"thc\",\"delete3\",\"delete2\",\"cbc\",\"cbca\",\"delete4\",\"cbda\",\"delete5\",\"delete6\",\"delete7\",\"cbg\",\"cbga\",\"delete8\",\"delete9\",\"cbn\",\"cbna\",\"delete10\",\"delete11\",\"thca\",\"thc8\",\"thc9\",\"delete\",\"thcv\",\"thcva\"))%>%\n  select(!contains(\"delete\"))%>%\n  filter(!license == \"Sandbox\")\n\n\n#here I will filter out accessories, clothing, employee product and high times cannabis cup items, as our testing analysis does not need them\nCurrentInvAllLicense_Cannabis <- CurrentInvAllLicense_orig%>%\n  filter(!category == \"Accessories\" & !category == \"Clothes\")%>%\n  mutate(\n    category_abrv = substr(product,1,3)\n  )%>%\n  relocate(category_abrv, .before = category)%>%\n  filter(!category_abrv == \"EMP\" & !category_abrv == \"SAM\" & !category_abrv == \"HTC\")%>%\n#here I have separate the units out for all of the testing results in order to have clean analysis  \n  separate(col = \"thc\", into = c(\"thc\",\"unit (%/mg)\"), sep = \" \", convert = TRUE)%>%\n  separate(col = \"cbd\", into = c(\"cbd\",NA), sep = \" \", convert = TRUE)%>%\n  separate(col = \"cbc\", into = c(\"cbc\",NA), sep = \" \", convert = TRUE)%>%\n  separate(col = \"cbca\", into = c(\"cbca\",NA), sep = \" \", convert = TRUE)%>%\n  separate(col = \"cbda\", into = c(\"cbda\",NA), sep = \" \", convert = TRUE)%>%\n  separate(col = \"cbg\", into = c(\"cbg\",NA), sep = \" \", convert = TRUE)%>%\n  separate(col = \"cbga\", into = c(\"cbga\",NA), sep = \" \", convert = TRUE)%>%\n  separate(col = \"cbn\", into = c(\"cbn\",NA), sep = \" \", convert = TRUE)%>%\n  separate(col = \"cbna\", into = c(\"cbna\",NA), sep = \" \", convert = TRUE)%>%\n  separate(col = \"thca\", into = c(\"thca\",NA), sep = \" \", convert = TRUE)%>%\n  separate(col = \"thc8\", into = c(\"thc8\",NA), sep = \" \", convert = TRUE)%>%\n  separate(col = \"thc9\", into = c(\"thc9\",NA), sep = \" \", convert = TRUE)%>%\n  separate(col = \"thcv\", into = c(\"thcv\",NA), sep = \" \", convert = TRUE)%>%\n  separate(col = \"thcva\", into = c(\"thcva\",NA), sep = \" \", convert = TRUE)%>%\n  relocate(\"unit (%/mg)\", .after = batch)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n",
