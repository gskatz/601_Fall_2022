For America the main livestock is cattle which counts peaked in 1975 and has been steadily declining since. The the second highest livestock reared in america is goats which has been raising year after year and was at its peak at the latest year with data available. In comparison the highest amount of pigs in america is approximately the same as the very minimum count of Pigs in China. The pig count has been exponentially been increasing until its peak in 2012. From this data it is apparent that pork is much more of a staple meat for people then it is for Americans whose staple meat is beef.  \n",
