Then you can read in the data, using either one of the `readr` standard tidy read commands, or a specialized package such as `readxl`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load in data and select relevant objects for analysis\n\nrailroads <- read_csv(\"_data/railroad_2012_clean_county.csv\")\nstate <- select(railroads, 'state')\ncounty <- select(railroads, 'county')\nwild_birds <- read_xlsx(\"_data/wild_bird_data.xlsx\", skip=1)\nstate_county <- read_xls(\"_data/StateCounty2012.xls\", skip=3)\nstate_county_trimmed <- select(state_county, 'STATE', 'COUNTY', 'TOTAL')\n```\n:::\n\n\nAdd any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data sets may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n# Railroads\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(railroads)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  state county               total_employees\n  <chr> <chr>                          <dbl>\n1 AE    APO                                2\n2 AK    ANCHORAGE                          7\n3 AK    FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR               2\n4 AK    JUNEAU                             3\n5 AK    MATANUSKA-SUSITNA                  2\n6 AK    SITKA                              1\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(railroads)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    state              county          total_employees  \n Length:2930        Length:2930        Min.   :   1.00  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:   7.00  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :  21.00  \n                                       Mean   :  87.18  \n                                       3rd Qu.:  65.00  \n                                       Max.   :8207.00  \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nunique(state, print = 53)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 53 × 1\n   state\n   <chr>\n 1 AE   \n 2 AK   \n 3 AL   \n 4 AP   \n 5 AR   \n 6 AZ   \n 7 CA   \n 8 CO   \n 9 CT   \n10 DC   \n# … with 43 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nunique (county, print = 1709)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1,709 × 1\n   county              \n   <chr>               \n 1 APO                 \n 2 ANCHORAGE           \n 3 FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR\n 4 JUNEAU              \n 5 MATANUSKA-SUSITNA   \n 6 SITKA               \n 7 SKAGWAY MUNICIPALITY\n 8 AUTAUGA             \n 9 BALDWIN             \n10 BARBOUR             \n# … with 1,699 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\"railroad_2012_county.csv\" is a comma separated value file containing information about the number of railroad employees in 2012 in each county in each state.
