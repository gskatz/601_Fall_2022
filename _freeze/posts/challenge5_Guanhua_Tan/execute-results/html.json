It covers 80 countries and different regions within each country. The dataset documents 21,903 schools' responses regarding 187 questions. Some key identifiers include CNT (Country Name), STRATUM (Region Name) and OECD (belongs to or not OECD)\n\n## Tidy Data (as needed)\n\nThe dataset covers 80 countries and regions including 21903 schools' responses regrading 187 questions. So I decided to narrow my reach here to five countries. I'd like to look at schools responses regarding a set of questions \"SC155\". SC155 survey the accessibility to digital device and its related training as well as assistance. I clean the data and group_by data as regional code. I decided to concentrate my analysis on a series questions of digital device (SC115Q). So I make two different datasets at first. One includes all identifier information. The other covers the columns that contains \"SC155Q\". Then, I use function \"cbind\" to combine these two into a new dataset (pisa2018_joint).Furthermore, I mutate 11 columns to calculate every country average regarding 11 questions. After that, I recognize the data with keeping columns of CNT, Region, OECD and 11 questions. Furthermore, I found that the questions from SC155Q01HA to SC155Q01HA focus on the accessibility to digital devices while the questions from SC155Q05HA to SC155Q11HA stress on if the schools offer enough training, support, and incentives. I mutate two new variables--\"Accessibility\" and \"Human_Resource_Support that respectively calculate the average of the former and the latter. Besides, I caculate every country average for \"Accessibility\" and \"Human_Resource_Support.\" After tidying data, the dataset has four columns and 80 rows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npisa2018_joint <- cbind(pisa[,1:12], pisa2018) %>%\n  select(CNT, STRATUM, OECD, SC155Q01HA,SC155Q02HA, SC155Q03HA, SC155Q04HA, SC155Q05HA,\n         SC155Q06HA, SC155Q07HA, SC155Q08HA, SC155Q09HA, SC155Q10HA, SC155Q11HA)\npisa2018_joint$Accessiblity=rowMeans(pisa2018_joint[,c(\"SC155Q01HA\",\"SC155Q02HA\", \"SC155Q03HA\",\"SC155Q04HA\")])\npisa2018_joint$Human_Resource_Support=rowMeans(pisa2018_joint[,c(\"SC155Q05HA\",\"SC155Q06HA\", \"SC155Q07HA\",\"SC155Q08HA\",\"SC155Q09HA\", \"SC155Q10HA\", \"SC155Q11HA\")])\npisa2018_joint_clean <-pisa2018_joint %>%\n  select(CNT, STRATUM, OECD, Accessiblity, Human_Resource_Support) %>%\n  group_by(CNT) %>%\n  mutate(Accessiblity_Country_Ave=mean(Accessiblity, na.rm=T)) %>%\n  mutate(Human_Resource_ave=mean(Human_Resource_Support, na.rm=T)) %>%\n  select(CNT,OECD, Accessiblity_Country_Ave, Human_Resource_ave) %>%\n  distinct() %>%\n  arrange(desc(Accessiblity_Country_Ave))\npisa2018_joint_clean\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 80 × 4\n# Groups:   CNT [80]\n   CNT    OECD Accessiblity_Country_Ave Human_Resource_ave\n   <chr> <dbl>                    <dbl>              <dbl>\n 1 SGP       0                     3.43               3.11\n 2 SWE       1                     3.36               3.06\n 3 QCI       0                     3.35               3.23\n 4 QAT       0                     3.27               3.16\n 5 DNK       1                     3.16               2.97\n 6 USA       1                     3.16               2.87\n 7 LTU       1                     3.15               3.04\n 8 ARE       0                     3.15               3.11\n 9 TAP       0                     3.14               2.98\n10 SVN       1                     3.12               2.96\n# … with 70 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Univariate Visualizations\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npisa2018_OECD <-pisa2018_joint_clean %>%\n  filter(OECD==\"1\") %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols=c(Accessiblity_Country_Ave, Human_Resource_ave), names_to = \"Group\", values_to = \"Evaluation\")\npisa2018_OECD %>%\n  ggplot(aes(Evaluation,\n             fill=Group))+\n  stat_boxplot(geom = \"errorbar\", # Error bars\n               width = 0.25)  +\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  facet_wrap(~Group)+\n  labs(title=\"Pisa2018 Digital Divce Evoluation (OECD)\")+\n  coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](challenge5_Guanhua_Tan_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# regional differences in Non-OECD countries\npisa2018_NONOECD <-pisa2018_joint_clean %>%\n  filter(OECD==\"0\") %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols=c(Accessiblity_Country_Ave, Human_Resource_ave), names_to = \"Group\", values_to = \"Evaluation\")\npisa2018_NONOECD %>%\n  ggplot(aes(Evaluation,\n             fill=Group))+\n  stat_boxplot(geom = \"errorbar\", # Error bars\n               width = 0.25)+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  facet_wrap(~Group)+\n  labs(title=\"Pisa2018 Digital Divce Evoluation (Non-OECD)\")+\n  coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](challenge5_Guanhua_Tan_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n \nIn order to further tidy data and create comparative graphics, I first used pivot_longer to create two new variables \"Group\" and \"Evaluation\".I put the original variables--\"Accessibility_Country_Ave\" and \"Human_Resource_ave\" names to the \"Group\" and values to \"Evaluation.\" \nThe box plot enjoys the reputation for clearly showing the distribution of a group of numbers, which allows me to disclose the distribution and general situation of every country's evaluation on digital devices. After cleaning and rearranging the dataset, I create four graphics. The boxplot graphics reveal that the OECD countries enjoy the higher access to digital devices than non-OECD countries. But these two groups have reported that their human resource evaluations are in the similar range. The latter reflects the limits to this survey's methodology. Because this survey is reliance on schools' self-report. There is no any objective measurements for them to measure their access to and human resources support on digital devices. Therefore, instead of reflecting that OECD countries lack human resources support, the data may show OECD and non-OECD countries have distinct expectations on human resources support. So self-report can only demonstrate the gap between their expectations and current situations.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# choose five countries to look at regional difference within the countries\n# United Kingdom (GBR), Hong Kong (HKG), Philippines (PHL), Argentina (ARG), Brazil(BRA)\npisa2018_joint_case_study <- pisa2018_joint  %>%\n  select(CNT, STRATUM, OECD, SC155Q01HA,SC155Q02HA, SC155Q03HA, SC155Q04HA, SC155Q05HA,\n         SC155Q06HA, SC155Q07HA, SC155Q08HA, SC155Q09HA, SC155Q10HA, SC155Q11HA) %>%\n  group_by(STRATUM) %>%\n  arrange(STRATUM) %>%\n  filter(CNT== \"GBR\" | CNT== \"HKG\" | CNT==\"PHL\"| CNT==\"ARG\" | CNT==\"BRA\" |CNT==\"FRA\" )\npisa2018_joint_case_study\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2,114 × 14\n# Groups:   STRATUM [129]\n   CNT   STRATUM  OECD SC155Q0…¹ SC155…² SC155…³ SC155…⁴ SC155…⁵ SC155…⁶ SC155…⁷\n   <chr> <chr>   <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 ARG   ARG0101     0         1       1       1       1       1       2       2\n 2 ARG   ARG0101     0        NA      NA      NA      NA      NA      NA      NA\n 3 ARG   ARG0101     0         2       1       2       2       2       2       2\n 4 ARG   ARG0101     0         2       1       2       3       2       2       1\n 5 ARG   ARG0101     0         1       1       2       2       2       2       2\n 6 ARG   ARG0101     0         3       2       3       2       2       2       1\n 7 ARG   ARG0101     0         1       1       1       1       1       3       1\n 8 ARG   ARG0101     0         1       1       1       1       1       1       1\n 9 ARG   ARG0101     0        NA      NA      NA      NA      NA      NA      NA\n10 ARG   ARG0101     0         1       1       1       1       2       2       2\n# … with 2,104 more rows, 4 more variables: SC155Q08HA <dbl>, SC155Q09HA <dbl>,\n#   SC155Q10HA <dbl>, SC155Q11HA <dbl>, and abbreviated variable names\n#   ¹​SC155Q01HA, ²​SC155Q02HA, ³​SC155Q03HA, ⁴​SC155Q04HA, ⁵​SC155Q05HA,\n#   ⁶​SC155Q06HA, ⁷​SC155Q07HA\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the question of SC15501HA to SC15505HA focus on the accessibility to digital device while the rest of six questions focus on human resource (teachers' training, assistance and motivation).
