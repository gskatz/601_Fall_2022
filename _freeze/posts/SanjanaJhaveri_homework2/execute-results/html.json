It was getting a little confusing without knowing which team had which ranking or which team got a certain number of passing yards.\nClean data by assigning a number to each team name and a column with a W or L depending on which team wins and potential research questions include will the team with the most passing yards always win. Will the team with the most receiving yards always win? Will the team with a higher offensive rating. Rename columns to clean data as well. Will the team with the higher ranking let's say >10 always win?\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(nfl$Home_Total_Yards)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 348.048\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(nfl$Opponent_Total_Yards)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 346.2134\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(nfl$Home_Passing_Yards)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 231.8302\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(nfl$Opponent_Passing_Yards)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 230.5542\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(nfl$Home_Rushing_Yards)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 116.2179\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(nfl$Opponent_Rushing_Yards)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 115.6592\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnfl%>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=`Home_Passing_Yards`, y=`Year`)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](SanjanaJhaveri_homework2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnfl%>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=`Opponent_Passing_Yards`, y=`Year`)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](SanjanaJhaveri_homework2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nPotential Research Questions:\n1.

If one team has more 1st downs than the other team, do they also win?\n5. What do the team's number of first downs have to with the team's total yards? Do they correlate?\n6.
