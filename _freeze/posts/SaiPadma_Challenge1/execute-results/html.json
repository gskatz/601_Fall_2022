Then you can read in the data, using either one of the `readr` standard tidy read commands, or a specialized package such as `readxl`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbird <- read_csv(\"/Users/pothula/Desktop/practice/601/601_Fall_2022/posts/_data/birds.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: '/Users/pothula/Desktop/practice/601/601_Fall_2022/posts/_data/birds.csv' does not exist.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbird\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'bird' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAdd any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data sets may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nThe data is describing the live animals(bird) count among various countries in different years.There are total 14 columns represting various factors.There is a column item that describes the type bird. It is also describes the value, whether the data is official or not for those recorded years \n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n\n#| label: summary\nx <- summary(bird)\nx\n\n\n",
