This data was likely collected at each station and submitted to a state or federal database. It is likely this information was gathered by station, given the data is grouped by state and then by county.  \n\nBelow I have outlined the distinct \"States\" which we can see there are 53 of, and that include District of Columbia and some Canadian railroads\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_distinct(railroads$state)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in list2(...): object 'railroads' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nunique(railroads$state)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in unique(railroads$state): object 'railroads' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
