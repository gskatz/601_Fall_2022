And anyone not familiar with Edward Tufte should check out his [fantastic books](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) and [courses on data visualizaton.](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses)\n\n(be sure to only include the category tags for the data you use!)\n\n## Read in data\n\nRead in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.\n\n  - eggs ⭐\n  - abc_poll ⭐⭐\n  - australian_marriage ⭐⭐\n  - hotel_bookings ⭐⭐⭐\n  - air_bnb  ⭐⭐⭐\n  - us_hh ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n  - faostat ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfaostat <- read_csv(\"_data/FAOSTAT_livestock.csv\",\n                          skip = 1,\n                          col_names = c(\"delete\", \"domain\", \"delete\", \"area\", \"delete\", \"delete\", \"animal code\", \"type\", \"delete\", \"year\",\n\"unit\", \"value\", \"flag\", \"delete\")) %>%\n  select(!starts_with(\"delete\")) %>%\n  na_if(\"Skipped\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Briefly describe the data\n\n## Tidy Data (as needed)\n\nIs your data already tidy, or is there work to be done? Be sure to anticipate your end result to provide a sanity check, and document your work here.\n\nI tidied the data by deleting some of the columns that were not needed or I thought wouldn't be useful in visualizing the data. For example, I deleted the year code column because the values there were the same values as the year column. I deleted the element and element code column because I didn't see what value those provided in visualizing the data. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  ggplot(faostat, aes(year, value, color = type)) + \n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](SanjanaJhaveri_challenge7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Visualization with Multiple Dimensions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfaostat %>%\n  filter(year >= 2010) %>%\n   ggplot(aes(unit, value, color = type)) + \n   geom_point()  +\n  facet_wrap(\"year\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](SanjanaJhaveri_challenge7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nIt seems that cattle have the most value for each head in the most recent years. Pigs and goats heads are also listed at a pretty high value. Conversely, sheep's heads are at the lowest value. Most of the recent years have basically the same  data on each animal type's value.\n",
