The first line of the dataset consists of the description of where it has been taken from which can be ignored for our analysis. Therefore, I have skipped the first row of the dataset and then read the excel and displayed the details. The dataset consists of 2 columns the \"body weight\" and the \"population_size\". The dimensions of the dataset is displayed i.e [146, 2].\n\n## Describe the data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Checking if there are any null values\nis.null(wild_birds_dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Summary of the dataset\nsummary(wild_birds_dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n Wet body weight [g] Population size  \n Min.   :   5.459    Min.   :      5  \n 1st Qu.:  18.620    1st Qu.:   1821  \n Median :  69.232    Median :  24353  \n Mean   : 363.694    Mean   : 382874  \n 3rd Qu.: 309.826    3rd Qu.: 198515  \n Max.   :9639.845    Max.   :5093378  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe wild birds dataset consists of only 2 columns body_weight and population_size which are both numerical values. Before we actually perform any analysis on the data and try to understand the distribution of the values in the dataset we need to make sure that there are no NULL values present in the data as it might effect our data adversely. We Could clearly see that there are no NULL values in the dataset we can summarize the data which will provide us  the statistical data of the dataset. The birds which have a very low body weight are very less in number whereas the birds which are heavier and have high body weight are high in number. This clearly says that the surival rate or the population size is directly proportional to the body weigt of the bird. The mean, median, min, max and other statistical information is displayed above.",
