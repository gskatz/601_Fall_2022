Data was collected on total Medicaid spending, total number of Medicaid claims, and total Dosage Units for each of the 2473  generic drugs covered by Medicaid between 2016-2020. The data set is designed to monitor changes in the total average weighted Medicaid drug spending per dosage unit over time.\n\nThe average weighted cost per dosage unit for a specific brand name, generic drug, by a manufacturer, in a specific year is calculated to take into account variations in the spending, dosage, and number of claims based on variations in drug strength, the dosage form, and the route of administration for a drug (i.e. a oral pill vs. a vaccine administered by needle). \n \n The strength, dosage, and route of brand name drugs is not included in the original Medicaid data set, and comes from administrative Medicaid data not available to the public (thus it can't be recreated)\n \nMore information on how average weighted cost per dosage unit was calculated information can  be found in **Appendix A**\n\nThe original data set contained outlier flags for years when the inclusion of potential incorrect data significantly impacted the average cost per drug dosage unit. An outlier was determined by being IQR +/- 1.5(IQR) of average cost per dosage unit. Overall weighted average cost per drug units were calculated with and without outliers, and if the inclusion of an outlier changed the weighted average cost per drug unit by more than 10% or $1, it is noted by a 1 in the outlier flag column. 30% of cases are flagged as having their average spending per dosage unit weighted in that year being impacted by outliers.\n\n\n## Read in Data\n\nColumns containing the average spending per claim,  changes in average spending per claim over time, and the constant average change in spending per dosage unit over time (from compound annual growth return CAGR) were deleted on the read in, as they can be recreated.\n\nThe 36 remaining columns were renamed according to the convention Measurement_Year to facilitate future cleaning and tidying of the data.\n \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Read In the Data\nMedicaid_Drug_Data <- read_csv(\"/Users/Emma/Desktop/Koding is Kewl/Medicaid_Spending_by_Drug_2020.csv\") %>%\n  select(!contains(\"Avg_Spnd_Per_Clm\")) %>%\n  select(!contains(\"Chg\")) %>% \n  select(!contains(\"CAGR\")) %>%\n  rename(\"Mftrs_Count\" = \"Tot_Mftr\", \n         \"TotSpndng_2016\" = \"Tot_Spndng_2016\", \n         \"TotDsgUnts_2016\" = \"Tot_Dsg_Unts_2016\", \n         \"TotClms_2016\" = \"Tot_Clms_2016\",\n         \"AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd_2016\"= \"Avg_Spnd_Per_Dsg_Unt_Wghtd_2016\",\n         \"OutlierFlag_2016\" =  \"Outlier_Flag_2016\", \n         \"TotSpndng_2017\" = \"Tot_Spndng_2017\",\n         \"TotDsgUnts_2017\" = \"Tot_Dsg_Unts_2017\", \n         \"TotClms_2017\" = \"Tot_Clms_2017\", \n         \"AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd_2017\" = \"Avg_Spnd_Per_Dsg_Unt_Wghtd_2017\",\n         \"OutlierFlag_2017\" =  \"Outlier_Flag_2017\",\n         \"TotSpndng_2018\" = \"Tot_Spndng_2018\",\n         \"TotDsgUnts_2018\" = \"Tot_Dsg_Unts_2018\",\n         \"TotClms_2018\" = \"Tot_Clms_2018\",\n         \"AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd_2018\"= \"Avg_Spnd_Per_Dsg_Unt_Wghtd_2018\",\n         \"OutlierFlag_2018\" =  \"Outlier_Flag_2018\", \n         \"TotSpndng_2019\" = \"Tot_Spndng_2019\",\n         \"TotDsgUnts_2019\" = \"Tot_Dsg_Unts_2019\", \n         \"TotClms_2019\" = \"Tot_Clms_2019\",\n         \"AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd_2019\"= \"Avg_Spnd_Per_Dsg_Unt_Wghtd_2019\",\n         \"OutlierFlag_2019\" =  \"Outlier_Flag_2019\", \n         \"TotSpndng_2020\" = \"Tot_Spndng_2020\", \n         \"TotDsgUnts_2020\" = \"Tot_Dsg_Unts_2020\",\n         \"TotClms_2020\" = \"Tot_Clms_2020\", \n         \"AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd_2020\"= \"Avg_Spnd_Per_Dsg_Unt_Wghtd_2020\", \n         \"OutlierFlag_2020\" =  \"Outlier_Flag_2020\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: '/Users/Emma/Desktop/Koding is Kewl/Medicaid_Spending_by_Drug_2020.csv' does not exist.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  Medicaid_Drug_Data\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Medicaid_Drug_Data' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Clean & Tidy the Data Set\nPrior to cleaning the Medicaid data set has 29 columns and 15,972 rows. Currently some rows contain data for \"Overall\" Manufacturer Name, which has information about all 4395 unique combinations of Brand Names and Generic name. For brand name and generic name drugs with only 1 manufacturer, these rows contain duplicate information.  In the  \"Mftrs_count\" column, the total number of manufacturers for any given drug is only contained in the \"Overall row\", with a Mftrs_count of 1 for every individual manufacturer row.\n\nPrior to pivoting the data, I want to replace the Manufacturers Count column with a column that actually contains the total number of manufacturers for a drug. I also want to remove all of the \"Overall\" rows from the data. \n\nTo accomplish this I created a new column called \"Number_Mftrs\" that contained manufacturer count whenever the manufacturer column contained \"Overall\". I then filled the number of manufacturers, so for every drug you can see the total number of manufacturers. I then removed the original Mftrs_Count column using select() and the Overall rows using filter().\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Separate the Overall from Mftr to Its Own Column of Total Number of Manufacturers \nMedicaid_Data <- Medicaid_Drug_Data%>%\n  mutate(Number_Mftrs = case_when(\n    str_detect(Mftr_Name, \"Overall\") ~ Mftrs_Count)) %>%\n    relocate(`Number_Mftrs`, .before= Mftrs_Count)%>%\n#Fill down total_mftrs\n  fill(Number_Mftrs)%>%\n  #Remove the Mftrs_Count Columns  \n  select(!ends_with(\"Count\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in mutate(., Number_Mftrs = case_when(str_detect(Mftr_Name, \"Overall\") ~ : object 'Medicaid_Drug_Data' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Remove the overall rows \nMedicaid_Data <- filter(Medicaid_Data, !str_detect(`Mftr_Name`,\"Overall\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in filter(Medicaid_Data, !str_detect(Mftr_Name, \"Overall\")): object 'Medicaid_Data' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMedicaid_Data\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Medicaid_Data' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are now 25 columns that contain a Measurement_Year.

I then separated out the year from the measurements to created a column of years. \n\nThis new \"Year\" column is categorical, but dates are ordinal variables.

The most common drug manufacturer in the data set is Mylan, which represents 2.8% of all cases. The number of manufacturers for a drug  ranges from 1 to 42, with a median of 7 manufacturers and a mode of 1 manufacturer.\n\nTo answer my research questions, I wanted to see descriptive statistics grouped by 1) Year & 2) Manufacturers. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Mean & median & sd of Total Spending Grouped by Year\nTotSpnding_by_Year <- Medicaid_Drug_DF%>%\n  group_by(Year)%>%\n  select(Year, TotSpndng) %>%\n  summarise(Mean_TotSpending= mean(TotSpndng, na.rm=TRUE), Median_TotSpending = median(TotSpndng, na.rm = TRUE), sd_TotSpending = sd(TotSpndng, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in group_by(., Year): object 'Medicaid_Drug_DF' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTotSpnding_by_Year\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'TotSpnding_by_Year' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at the mean and median total Medicaid spending on a drug by year, I was surprised to see that the mean and median of total Medicaid per drug spending consistently decreased from 2016 to 2020. In 2016 the mean total Medicaid spending on any drug was $9,131,003, and in 2020 this the mean total Medicaid spending for any drug fell to $6,315,899. Based on inflation, I would have expected mean total Medicaid spending per drug to increase over time not decrease. However, looking at mean and median total spending alone does not factor in changes in dosage units and number of claims between years, which might explain some of these differences.\n\nTo look at this, I will now look at the mean and median of average Medicaid spending per dosage unit weighted by number of claims for each year between 2016-2020.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Mean & median of Average Spending per dosage unit by year\nAvgSpndingPerDsgUnitWghted_by_Year <- Medicaid_Drug_DF%>%\n  group_by(Year)%>%\n  select(Year, AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd) %>%\n  summarise(Mean_AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd= mean(AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd, na.rm=TRUE), Median_AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd = median(AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd, na.rm = TRUE), sd_AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd = sd(AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in group_by(., Year): object 'Medicaid_Drug_DF' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nAvgSpndingPerDsgUnitWghted_by_Year\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'AvgSpndingPerDsgUnitWghted_by_Year' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe mean average Medicaid spending per dosage unit weighted by number of claims for a drug steadily increased from $88 a dosage unit in 2016 to $262 in 2020. The median Medicaid average weighted Medicaid spending per dosage unit weight is vastly different from the mean, and are all around $1.5 per dosage unit. The mean average spending per dosage unit weighted by number of claims being so much lower than the median suggests that outliers in price for some drugs greatly impact the mean average spending per dosage unit weighted by claims.\n\n\nLooking at just the mean and median total spending and average spending per dosage unit weighted for any drug does not tell me what I want to know. So instead I will look at the sum of the total spending and average spending per dosage unit weighted by number of claims for each Brand name drug, of a generic, with a manufacturer for each year. The sum of all spending and weighted average spending for all drugs (Brand Name, Generic Name, Manufacturers Name) will let me compare the total spending & average weighted spending per dosage unit between years without being as influenced by outliers as a mean or median.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Summing Total Spending\nSumTotSpnding_by_Year <- Medicaid_Drug_DF%>%\n  group_by(Year)%>%\n  select(Year, TotSpndng) %>%\n  summarise(Sum_TotSpending= sum(TotSpndng, na.rm=TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in group_by(., Year): object 'Medicaid_Drug_DF' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSumTotSpnding_by_Year\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'SumTotSpnding_by_Year' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#summed Total Spending by Year per Unique Drug\nggplot(SumTotSpnding_by_Year, aes(x=Year, y = `Sum_TotSpending`, fill =Year)) + \n    geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") + ggtitle(\"Figure 1: Sum of Annual Total Medicaid Spending For all Drugs for 2016-2020\") + labs (x=\"Year\", y=\"Sum of Total Medicaid Spending per Drug($)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in ggplot(SumTotSpnding_by_Year, aes(x = Year, y = Sum_TotSpending, : object 'SumTotSpnding_by_Year' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nLooking at the sum of all total Medicaid drug spending in the above Figure 1 for each year, one can see how the combined total Medicaid drug spending for all covered drugs steadily increased over time between 2016-2020.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#summed  averaged weighted Medicaid spending per dosage unit \nSumAvgWghtedSpndingPerDsgUnt_Year <- Medicaid_Drug_DF%>%\n  group_by(Year)%>%\n  select(Year, AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd) %>%\n  summarise(Sum_AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd= sum(AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd, na.rm=TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in group_by(., Year): object 'Medicaid_Drug_DF' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSumAvgWghtedSpndingPerDsgUnt_Year\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'SumAvgWghtedSpndingPerDsgUnt_Year' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#summed  averaged weighted Medicaid spending per dosage unit \nggplot(SumAvgWghtedSpndingPerDsgUnt_Year , aes(x=Year, y = Sum_AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd, fill =Year)) + \n    geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") + ggtitle(\"Figure 2: Sum of Annual Average Weighted Medicaid Spending Per Dosage Unit For all Drugs for 2016-2020\") + labs (x=\"Year\", y=\"Sum of Average Weighted Medicaid Spending per Dosage Unit($)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in ggplot(SumAvgWghtedSpndingPerDsgUnt_Year, aes(x = Year, y = Sum_AvgSpndPerDsgUntWghtd, : object 'SumAvgWghtedSpndingPerDsgUnt_Year' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nFigure 2 above shows the sum of the average weighted Medicaid spending by dosage unit graphed vs year.

You can see the mode cumulative Medicaid per drug spending for a manufacturer is below $100,000, which is much more clear than in Figure 4 where the mode look likes somewhere between $0 & $2.5 billion dollars. \n\nOverall while some manufacturers made hundreds of billions of dollars off of Medicaid drug spending between 2016-2020, the majority of manufacturers made under $500,000 from cumulative Medicaid drug spending over the past 5 years. These visualizations suggest that for RQ2 Medicaid spending does vary by manufacturer, with a select number of manufacturers, such as Gilead Sciences and Otsuka America, making tens of billions of cumulative dollars on drugs purchased through Medicaid. \n\n## Limitations and Next Steps\nA key area for future research to expand upon is to re-run the visualizations with all drug values flagged as being outliers removed, to see if this impacted the distribution of the data as well as the answer to my research questions. Based on time limitations and the fact that this data set is not being used for my final project, examining outliers is not something I am going to attempt to do today.\n\nAnother interesting future step would be to look at the drugs that had the most Medicaid Spending, and see if there are any trends in terms of the types of drugs that are most commonly taken, such as pain killers, antibiotics, insulin etc.\n\nAn overall limitation of this analysis was my lack of familiarity with the data set. Even after reading the methods and data dictionary it was hard to conceptualize the averages, totals, and sums of averages and totals. My struggle with this data set pushed me to use a different data set for the final that I am familiar with using through my work. A key to a good analysis is truly understanding your data set and what you want to do with it, so I look forward to showcasing that in my final.\n\n\n## Appendix A Calculating Weighted Average Spending per Dosage Unit ##\nThe average weighted cost per dosage unit incorporates 6 variables:\n\n - The total spending on a brand name drug* \n - The total number Medicaid claims on a brand name drug*\n - The total dosage units of a brand name drug*\n - The specific strength of a brand name drug*\n - The dosage form of a brand name drug*\n - The route of administration for a brand name drug*\n \n * = of a specific generic name, by a specific manufacturer, in a specific year\n \n The strength, dosage, and route of brand name drugs is not included in the original  data set, and comes from administrative Medicaid data.\n \n\n\"Since drugs are available in multiple strengths and dosage forms, the average spending per dosage unit at the brand name and generic name level is weighted to account for variation in claims volume for specific brand name, generic name, strength, dosage form, routes of administration, and manufacturer levels.The overall brand name/generic name claim weighted spending per unit is calculated by first summarizing each drug to specific strength, form, route of administration, and manufacture levels. For each unique level, spending is divided by the number of units and multiplied by its proportion of total claims, so that claims volume becomes the weight.\nThe claim-weighted average spending per dosage unit at the overall brand name/generic name level is then calculated by summarizing across the strength, form, route, and manufacturer levels. A similar approach was used to calculate average spending per unit for specific manufacturers\" - CMS, 2022\n\n\nFor example, a drug could be administered in the 2 following combinations of forms, strengths, and routes:\n\n - Form = Vial, Strength = 80MG/4ML, Route = Intravenous\n - Form = Syringe, Strength = 162MG/0.9, Route = Subcutaneous\n \nFor each unique combination of drug form/strength/route, a weighted drug cost per unit was calculated by:\n\n**(Cost of Drug/Units of Drug) * Number of Claims**\n\nThe total number of claims, total number of dosage units, the total cost of drugs, and the total weighted cost per unit were calculated by summing the information from each combination of of drug form/strength/route of administration.\n\nThe final drug weighted average cost per unit is calculated by:\n\n**Total Weighted Cost Per Unit / Total Claims **\n\n\n\n## Citations\n\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. *Medicaid Spending By Drug*.
