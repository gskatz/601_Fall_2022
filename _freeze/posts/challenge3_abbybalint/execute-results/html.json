The reason that pivoting will be helping in visualizing the data here is because in the current format, we cannot filter by animal because each animal is its own variable. Pivoting the data will allow us to filter the data set easily based on animal to find average weights and filter by both animal type and region of the world.\n\n\n### Challenge: Describe the final dimensions\n\nTo find the below final dimensions, I used the same formula as the example but used the animal weights data. My original data set started with 9 rows and 17 variables. Only one of the original variables will remain a variable. The 16 variables I am pivoting will turn into two variables - animal (names), and weights (values). My row numbers will now be 144 because I will have the 9 rows times the 16 variables I am transforming. I should end up with 3 columns, my one original variable and my 2 new variables.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#existing rows/cases\nnrow(weights)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 9\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#existing columns/cases\nncol(weights)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 17\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#expected rows/cases\nnrow(weights) * (ncol(weights)-1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 144\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# expected columns \n1+1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n144 rows as expected :)\n\n\n### Challenge: Pivot the Chosen Data\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npivot_longer(weights, \"Cattle - dairy\":\"Llamas\",\n                 names_to=\"animal\",\n                 values_to = \"weights\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 144 × 3\n   `IPCC Area`         animal             weights\n   <chr>               <chr>                <dbl>\n 1 Indian Subcontinent Cattle - dairy       275  \n 2 Indian Subcontinent Cattle - non-dairy   110  \n 3 Indian Subcontinent Buffaloes            295  \n 4 Indian Subcontinent Swine - market        28  \n 5 Indian Subcontinent Swine - breeding      28  \n 6 Indian Subcontinent Chicken - Broilers     0.9\n 7 Indian Subcontinent Chicken - Layers       1.8\n 8 Indian Subcontinent Ducks                  2.7\n 9 Indian Subcontinent Turkeys                6.8\n10 Indian Subcontinent Sheep                 28  \n# … with 134 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFinal tibble has three columns and 144 rows as predicted.\n",
