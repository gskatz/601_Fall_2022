The column names are STATE, COUNTY, and TOTAL EMPLOYEES. This data shows the number of railroad employees in each county and is organized by state. There were some abbreviations I did not recognize, so I did more research. AE and AP are Armed Forces Europe and Armed Forces Pacific. Texas had the largest number of employees with 19839 employees.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nas_tibble(railroads)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in as_tibble(railroads): object 'railroads' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#groups the data by state in descending order of employees\nrailroads%>%\n  group_by(state)%>%\n  summarise(total=sum(total_employees))%>%\n  arrange(desc(total)) %>%\nslice(1:10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in group_by(., state): object 'railroads' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#groups the data by state name alphabetically\nrailroads %>%\n  select(state)%>%\n  group_by(state) %>%\n  arrange(state)%>%\n slice(1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in select(., state): object 'railroads' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Part 2: Birds Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirds <- read_csv(\"/Users/143660/Documents/GitHub/601_Fall_2022/posts/_data/birds.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: '/Users/143660/Documents/GitHub/601_Fall_2022/posts/_data/birds.csv' does not exist.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Describe the Data - Birds\n\nThis dataset is a bit larger - there are 14 columns and 30977 rows. The columns are Domain.Code, Domain, Area.Code, Area, Element.Code, Element, item.code, item, year.code, year, unit, value, flag,flag.Description. The 5 item categories are chickens, Ducks, Geese and guinea fowls, turkeys, and pigeons and other birds. There are 248 areas and the data is tracked from 1961 to 2018. Flag description must be how the birds were counted. The data was organized into these categories: Aggregate, may include official, semi-official, estimated or calculated data, Data not available, FAO data based on imputation methodology FAO estimare, Official Data, and unofficial figure. Based on this information, this dataset counts the number of birds in the world from 1961 - 2018 using flagging techniques. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(birds)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in head(birds): object 'birds' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(select(birds, Item))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in select(birds, Item): object 'birds' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(select(birds, Year))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in select(birds, Year): object 'birds' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(select(birds, \"Flag Description\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in select(birds, \"Flag Description\"): object 'birds' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
