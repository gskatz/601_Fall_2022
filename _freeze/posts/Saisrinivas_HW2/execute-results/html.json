Its class is also character but we will need to convert it into date class because it ill help us create a time series to plot the graph later.\nOpen is the column which tells us the opening price on that day. It is a numeric class.\nHigh is the highest value of the currency on that day. It is a numeric class.\nLow is the lowest value of that currency on that day. It is a numeric class.\nClose is the value of the currency after the market closes on that day. It is a numeric class.\nVolume is the total amount of coins that are available for trade. It is a numeric class.\nMarket cap is the value of the coins multiplied by the volume. It is a numeric class.\n\n## Potential Research Questions:\n\nSome of the research questions we can use to analyze or find something from this data is:\n\n- Which coin dominated in which years in terms of market capitalization?\n- Why the different prices of the cryptocurrencies from the years 2017 to 2021 because thats when these digital assets became a super hit?\n- Why Bitcoin's volume decreased during 2020-2021 while tether's volume kept increasing?\n\n\n",
