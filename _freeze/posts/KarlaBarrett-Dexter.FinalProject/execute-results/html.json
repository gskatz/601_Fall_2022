This is something I consider quite a bit, as I manage a medical residency program and one of our goals is to increase the diversity of our faculty and residents to better reflect the demographics of the patient population we are caring for. This goal has yet to be achieved, so I thought it would be interesting to explore some data about migration patterns to and from Maine and ask, \"is Maine becoming a more diverse state?\". This was the original impetus for my final paper, however, I also found it interesting to explore where people are moving to when they leave Maine and where they are moving from when they come to Maine.\n\n\n\n\n## Data\nThe data chosen for this project details migration patterns for people born between the years 1984 and 1992. The data was captured by US Census, tax and HUD reporting.The primary variables of interest are: origin city/state (where the person was living at age 16) and destination city/state (where the person was living at age 26), race, and parental income level. The data was downloaded from migrationpatterns.org, a collaborative research project between the U.S. Census Bureau and Harvard University.\n\nI tidied the data in a few ways:\n\n1. Read in the data and labeled the original data frame \"MillenialMigration\"\n2. Renamed the column names for ease of understanding (e.g. d_cz_name became Dest_City)\n3. The race and parental income data was combined in one column in the original data set. I decided to separate out the two data points into different columns by using the mutate function to replace the original character format (e.g. AsianQ1) to a format that included an underscore (e.g. Asian_Q1) so I could then use the separate function, with the underscore as the separator to create the two distinct columns.I thought it would be interesting to be able to explore the race and income level data points on their own.\n4. Finally, after struggling with the lag time to process all the code to accomplish separating out the columns, I opted to save the new data frame as a csv file using write.csv so I could continue on with the project without waiting for the code to run from start to finish every time I revisited my work. I have included all the code used to get to this point as comments. \n\nAfter the initial tidying, I started zeroing in on the data for Maine, by creating new data frames for:\n\n1. Migration to Maine\n2. Migration from Maine\n3. Both migration to and from Maine\n\nSome of the questions I wanted to explore at this point were:\n\n1. Did more people migrate to or from Maine?\n2. Migration to Maine\n    - Where did people migrate from?\n    - Where in Maine did they settle?\n    - Is there a clear race or parental income level pattern for migration into the state? Is there a difference between a popular urban location        such as Portland, and a more rural city such as Augusta?\n3. Migration from Maine\n    - Where did they go?\n    - Race or parental income level patterns?\n\nTo help me answer some of my questions, I did some setup by summarizing and joining of data such as migration patterns by Maine cities, states, race, and parental income. This setup was to aid in additional transformations and visualizations. A lot of this work ended up being unnecessary, but it was good practice!\n  \nInterestingly, there are only four Maine cities reflected in the data set: Portland, Bangor, Presque Isle, and Calais, which certainly turned my focus away from spending too much time looking into where exactly in Maine people moved to and from as those four cities do not paint a full picture. Portland is by far the largest city by population so it would not be surprising to see the most migration in and out of Portland due to that fact alone. The four cities included in the original data set as they are vastly different, especially Presque Isle and Calais, are two of the most remote towns in the state.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#| label: Data Transformations\n#| warning: false\n#| \n#Read in original data set\nMillenialMigration <- read_csv(\"_data/od.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: '_data/od.csv' does not exist in current working directory ('C:/Users/srika/OneDrive/Desktop/601_Fall_2022/posts').\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMillenialMigration\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'MillenialMigration' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Changed column names for ease of understanding\nMillenialMigration <- MillenialMigration %>%\n  rename(Origin_Zone = o_cz,\n         Origin_City = o_cz_name,\n         Origin_State = o_state_name,\n         Dest_Zone = d_cz,\n         Dest_City = d_cz_name,\n         Dest_State = d_state_name,\n         Num_Migrators = n,\n         N_from_Origin = n_tot_o,\n         N_from_Dest = n_tot_d,\n         Race_ParentalIncome = pool,\n         Num_Migrators = n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in rename(., Origin_Zone = o_cz, Origin_City = o_cz_name, Origin_State = o_state_name, : object 'MillenialMigration' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMillenialMigration\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'MillenialMigration' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#I wanted to separate the Race and Parental Income data, in order to analyze the data separately in future iterations. I could not figure out a way to separate the two  without putting a character in between. I used the following code to update the Race_ParentalIncome column to have an underscore in it. This was probably  not the most efficient way to accomplish this outcome and it took me quite a while to get the code right.In addition, I found it was taking a very long time to run this code every time I returned to work on the assignment, so I decided to export the new CSV file and am writing in all the code used to get to this step as comments to show my work and continuing with the new file

Visualizations: State to State Movement\n\nThe first visualization I created was simply to compare the total number of migrators in and out of each city.Portland and Bangor saw the most migration, Calais and Presque Isle saw the least, the results were not surprising given the population size of each city as mentioned before. Each city experienced more migration out than in.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Table transformation and ggplot code for total number of migrators from each Maine city\nMigrationMaineCombined <- Migration_In_And_Out_Maine %>% gather(Total, Value, -City)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in gather(., Total, Value, -City): object 'Migration_In_And_Out_Maine' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMigrationMaineCombined \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'MigrationMaineCombined' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(MigrationMaineCombined, aes(x = City, y = Value, fill = Total)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") + labs(title = \"Maine Migration by Cities\", y = \"Total Migrators\", x = \"City in Maine\") + geom_text(aes(label = Value, hjust = \"center\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in ggplot(MigrationMaineCombined, aes(x = City, y = Value, fill = Total)): object 'MigrationMaineCombined' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe next question I explored was where are people migrating to Maine from? It turns out, the vast most of the migration in Maine is occurring within Maine. After inter-state movement, the largest group of people to move to Maine were from other Northeastern states (VT, NY, CT, NH, etc.). I originally made the visualization to include all states, but decided to filter it down to the top 10. I also chose to put the states on the y axis for a better visual representation. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#| label: Where did they come from?\n#| warning: false\n\n#Original code for plot with all states: ggplot(To_Maine_Sum_By_State, aes(Num_Migrators_to_Maine, State)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"cadetblue\")\n\nTo_Maine_Sum_By_State %>%\n  filter(Num_Migrators_to_Maine >= 637) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(Num_Migrators_to_Maine, State)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"cadetblue\") + labs(title = \"Where Did People Come to Maine From?\", x = \"Number of Migrators\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in filter(., Num_Migrators_to_Maine >= 637): object 'To_Maine_Sum_By_State' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nAfter, I used the same process to create a graph showing where people from Maine were moving to. Seven of the top 10 states showed up on both lists. The three states on the list of places people moved to Maine from but not on the list of states people moved to were: Vermont, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Alternatively, the three states not in the top ten list for states people moved from are: Texas, North Carolina, and Colorado.

I created two versions of this, the second with a facet wrap after creating a new column with grouped values.The facet wrap helped spread the plot points out and I believe made it a better visual aid. Although, there is not much to take away from these charts other than viewing the difference between migration to and from Maine between different states.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Join to and from Maine\nTo_and_From_Maine_ByState <- inner_join(To_Maine_Sum_By_State, From_Maine_Sum_By_State, by=\"State\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in inner_join(To_Maine_Sum_By_State, From_Maine_Sum_By_State, by = \"State\"): object 'To_Maine_Sum_By_State' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTo_and_From_Maine_ByState_Combined <- To_and_From_Maine_ByState %>% gather(Total, Value, -State)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in gather(., Total, Value, -State): object 'To_and_From_Maine_ByState' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(To_and_From_Maine_ByState_Combined, aes(x = Value, y = State)) +\n  geom_point() + labs(title = \"Where Did People Move to and From\", y = \"State\", x = \"Value\")+\n  geom_point(aes(color = factor(Total)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in ggplot(To_and_From_Maine_ByState_Combined, aes(x = Value, y = State)): object 'To_and_From_Maine_ByState_Combined' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nToAndFrom <- To_and_From_Maine_ByState_Combined %>% mutate(Total = case_when(Value <100 ~ \"Under 100 Migrators\", \n                                     Value <500 ~ \"Under 500 Migrators\",\n                                     Value >501 ~ \"Over 500  Migrators\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in mutate(., Total = case_when(Value < 100 ~ \"Under 100 Migrators\", : object 'To_and_From_Maine_ByState_Combined' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nToAndFrom <- To_and_From_Maine_ByState_Combined %>%\n  select(State, Total, Value)%>%\n  mutate(\n    Value_Groups = case_when(Value <100 ~ \"Under 100 Migrators\", \n                                     Value <500 ~ \"Under 500 Migrators\",\n                                     Value >501 ~ \"Over 500  Migrators\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in select(., State, Total, Value): object 'To_and_From_Maine_ByState_Combined' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nToAndFrom\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'ToAndFrom' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nState_Movement_Facet <- ggplot(ToAndFrom, aes(x = Value, y = State)) +\n  geom_point() + labs(title = \"Where Did People Move to and From\", y = \"State\", x = \"Value\")+\n  geom_point(aes(color = factor(Total)))+\n  facet_wrap(~Value_Groups)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in ggplot(ToAndFrom, aes(x = Value, y = State)): object 'ToAndFrom' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nState_Movement_Facet\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'State_Movement_Facet' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Visualizations: Race and Income\nI moved on to exploring the relationship between migration patterns and race and income levels (specifically parental income levels, which I think is important to note as generational wealth is a significant factor in someone's ability to move). \n\nI grouped the data by parental income or race for both Maine data, and the original data set as a whole, then summarized the number of migrators in each category. I renamed columns in order to join the the Maine data and the total data in one data frame that would allow me to compare the data in the same visualization. \n\nThe migration patterns by race were similar for both Maine and the entire data set. The income category however saw an oddity, the highest parental income quintile in Maine saw very little migration compared to the migration patterns for the whole data set. \n\nGiven how much more migration is seen among white populations, I wanted to focus in on non-white populations to help answer my question of \"is Maine becoming more diverse\". I found the difference between the number of non-white migrators that came to Maine and left Maine and created a bar chart. There was a very slight increase in black and hispanic populations, but asian and \"other\" both dropped. Overall, based on this limited data set, it appears Maine is not becoming more diverse.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Migrators by Income Data Transformation\nMigratorsByIncome <- MillenialMigration_Sep %>%\n  group_by(Parental_Income) %>%\n  summarise(Num_Migrators= sum(Num_Migrators)) %>%\n  rename(Num_All_Income = Num_Migrators)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in group_by(., Parental_Income): object 'MillenialMigration_Sep' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMaine_Migration_Income <- MillenialMigration_Maine_All %>%\n  group_by(Parental_Income) %>%\n  summarise(Num_Migrators= sum(Num_Migrators)) %>%\n  rename(Num_Maine_Income = Num_Migrators)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in group_by(., Parental_Income): object 'MillenialMigration_Maine_All' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMaine_vs_All_Income <- inner_join(MigratorsByIncome, Maine_Migration_Income, by=\"Parental_Income\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in inner_join(MigratorsByIncome, Maine_Migration_Income, by = \"Parental_Income\"): object 'MigratorsByIncome' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMaine_vs_All_Income_Transform <- Maine_vs_All_Income %>% gather(AllOrMaine, Num_Migrators, -Parental_Income)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in gather(., AllOrMaine, Num_Migrators, -Parental_Income): object 'Maine_vs_All_Income' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMaine_vs_All_Income_Transform_Groups<- Maine_vs_All_Income_Transform %>%\n  select(Parental_Income, Num_Migrators, AllOrMaine)%>%\n  mutate(\n    AllorMaineGroups = case_when(AllOrMaine == \"Num_All_Income\" ~ \"All Data\", AllOrMaine == \"Num_Maine_Income\" ~ \"Maine Data\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in select(., Parental_Income, Num_Migrators, AllOrMaine): object 'Maine_vs_All_Income_Transform' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(Maine_vs_All_Income_Transform_Groups, aes(x = Num_Migrators, y = Parental_Income)) +\n  geom_count()+ labs(title = \"Migration by Income Level -

For example, after working with the data, I determined the best visualizations to use would be bar charts and point plots, due to the fact that I was only working with one numerical variable. Upon reviewing the report, I discovered there are so many more possibilities and I am both glad I did not see it beforehand (to keep my goal output realistic) and a bit disappointed I did not experiment more with histograms box plots, for example. Also, after reviewing the report, I would like to learn how to plot the migration data on a map of the U.S. I researched how to do it a bit and determined it was not feasible for this project but I would like to keep trying in the future. \n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of this project was the time spent trying to find tiny little mistakes that affected large portions of my work (a missed comma, using the wrong column name, using + when I needed to use %>%), but ultimately, I found the experience to be incredibly valuable as I am now much better at spotting mistakes and every problem solved, no matter how little felt like a huge win. Another challenge I had that I did not end up solving is changing the order of the facets in my charts. I searched for multiple hours for a solution to no avail and the order of the facets did not end up in ascending or descending order.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOne of the questions I was looking to answer with this project was, \"is Maine becoming more diverse?\". The conclusion I came to with this data set is, no. However, there are a number of factors that limited my ability to fully explore this question:\n\n  1. This data set is not capturing migration from other countries. Maine has seen an increase in immigrant and refugee resettlement, particularly     in the larger cities (Portland, Lewiston, Augusta, Bangor) since this time frame in which this data was collected.\n  2. Maine has also seen in influx in migration from other states due to the pandemic and the remote work revolution, data from the past few years     would likely look different than this data from 1984-1992. \n\nOther questions I still have are:\n\n  1. What incomes ranges are included in each quintile?\n  2. How much does college choice affect migration patterns? - I think this would be an interesting question to explore!\n  3. How was the data chosen? \n  4. Why are only four cities in Maine included in the data set?\n\n## Bibliography \n\nTextbook:\nGrolemund, G., & Wickham, H. (2017). R for Data Science.
