The clean \"Birds_Clean\" data frame has 5 columns: Area, Item, Year, Number_of_Birds, and Flag Description.\n\nThe Area column contains the location of the bird-stock, ranging from estimates of the total bird-stock world-wide, for entire continents, or for individual countries. There are 248 unique areas in the data frame. By using the arrange(), select(), and slice() functions it was determined that the with \"World\" having the most number of birds of any area followed by Asia, while the areas with the fewest total number of birds tended to be islands.\n\nThe Item column refers to which of the 5 types of bird-stocks is being measured in each row: chickens, ducks, geese or fowl, pigeons/other birds, or turkeys. Chickens were the most common item type (42.7% of all items) and pigeons, other birds was the least common item type (3.8% of all items).\n\nThe Year column is self explanatory and spans 58 years ranging from 1961 through 2018. Year seemed to contribute to the size of number of birds, with the top 10 most number of birds all occurring between the 10 year of 2009 through 2018. This suggests the size of bird stocks is likely increasing over time.\n\nThe \"Number_of_Birds\" column describes the number of birds for each item type in the specified location and year. The minimum number of birds was 0, the median number of birds was 1.8 million, the mean number of birds was 99.4 million, and the maximum number of birds is 23.7 billion. The mode number of birds was 2,000, which was determined graphically. 1036 rows had N/A for Number_of_Birds meaning that value was missing from the data set.\n\nLastly, the Flag Description column refers to the origin of each data and can be used to gauge the data_quality with 6 different flag descriptions: Aggregate data, Data not available, FAO data based on imputation, FAO estimate, Official data, and Unofficial data. Using the FAO flag descriptions from the table of top 50 number of birds, the data for largest total number of birds were determined using aggregate data.\n\n## Provide Grouped Summary Statistics, Explain, & Interpret\n\nConduct some exploratory data analysis, using dplyr commands such as `group_by()`, `select()`, `filter()`, and `summarise()`. Find the central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, mix/max/quantile) for different subgroups within the data set.\n\n**Area and Total Number of Birds**\n\nAfter reading in, previewing, and describing the Birds_Clean data set, I decided it would be interesting to look at the relationship between Area and Number of Birds. When looking at tables of the largest and smallest bird-stocks, area seemed to significantly factor into size of bird stocks, so decided to look more closely at this.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Using group_by(), select(), summarize(), and arrange() to generate a table of Area of mean and median total number of birds descending by the median value\nBirds_Clean %>%\n  group_by(Area)%>%\n  select(Area, Number_of_Birds) %>%\n  summarise( mean_birds= mean(Number_of_Birds, na.rm=TRUE), median_birds = median(Number_of_Birds, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(median_birds))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 248 × 3\n   Area                      mean_birds median_birds\n   <chr>                          <dbl>        <dbl>\n 1 World                    2565908193.    328049000\n 2 China, mainland           981424759.    320500000\n 3 USSR                      413426790.    247250000\n 4 United States of America  536970356.    240219000\n 5 Nigeria                   104694569.    116370000\n 6 Asia                     1246442041.    103030000\n 7 Eastern Asia              679408245.     96090000\n 8 India                     177719707.     68307500\n 9 Americas                  856355944.     66923500\n10 Indonesia                 368163560.     60005500\n# … with 238 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUsing the piping, group_by(), select(),summarize(), and arrange() functions, I created a table of the mean and median values per area, descending by median. I arranged the data-set by median as it is less likely to be skewed by outliers than the mean. The mean number of birds for the Area of the world was 2.57 billion, which is almost 8 times larger than the median number of birds for the world, which was 328 million. The areas with highest median total number of birds, starting with the highest are: World, \"China, mainland, USSR, United States of America, Nigeria, Asia, Eastern Asia, India, Americas, and Indonesia. It made sense that the World has the highest median value of all areas, but I was surprised that the China (mainland), USSR, the USA, and Nigeria all had a higher area median value than Asia, when considering that the highest 50 total number of birds were all based in the area of World or Asia. A confusing finding is that the median Value for the USA is higher than the median value for\"the Americas\" which the USA is a part of, so I'd be curious to know if something brought the median down for the Americas. Along those lines, it would be interesting to know what feature of Nigeria make it have a higher median number of birds than its continent of Africa.\n\nDescending, the 10 lowest median values by area were Liechtenstein, Papua New Guinea, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, Jordan, Cayman Islands, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Nauru, Tokelau, Falkland Islands (Malvinas), and Aruba. It follows earlier patterns observed from the lowest 50 values that islands comprised the majority of area with low values, as the climate of small islands is likely not conducive for poultry-stock. Liechtenstein and Jordan do not follow this pattern, as a small German town and a West-African country, and it would be interesting to learn why they are on this list. These ten areas with the lowest median values ranged from 0-12,000 birds which means these areas likely need to rely heavily on poultry imports or other protein sources.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Using group_by(), select(), summarize(), and arrange() to generate a table of Area of min, max, sd, IQR, and range of number of birds,  descending by range/\n\nBirds_Clean %>%\n  group_by(Area)%>%\n  select(Area, Number_of_Birds)%>%\n  summarise(min_birds = min(Number_of_Birds, na.rm = TRUE), max_birds = max(Number_of_Birds, na.rm =TRUE), range_birds = max_birds-min_birds, sd_birds= sd(Number_of_Birds, na.rm=TRUE), IQR_birds = IQR(Number_of_Birds, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n   arrange(desc(range_birds))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 248 × 6\n   Area               min_birds   max_birds range_birds    sd_birds IQR_birds\n   <chr>                  <dbl>       <dbl>       <dbl>       <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1 World               12068000 23707134000 23695066000 5297664399. 985833500\n 2 Asia                 3408000 13630958000 13627550000 2776107770. 926803250\n 3 Eastern Asia           93000  5884748000  5884655000 1372882881. 665932250\n 4 Americas              553000  5796289000  5795736000 1539315549. 545152000\n 5 China, mainland     15000000  5274475000  5259475000 1436610595. 599500000\n 6 South-eastern Asia     42000  3862039000  3861997000  680622395. 157789500\n 7 Southern Asia         350000  2786706000  2786356000  565733859. 103088000\n 8 South America         199000  2611687000  2611488000  615392924. 112260000\n 9 Europe               2417000  2486932000  2484515000  777666805.  97111000\n10 Indonesia            5300000  2384147000  2378847000  579077970. 488042250\n# … with 238 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Creating a boxplot of Number of Birds by Area\nggplot(Birds_Clean, aes(Area, Number_of_Birds)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_minimal() + labs(title = \"Boxplot of FAO Total Number of Birds by Area\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](challenge2_EmmaNarkewicz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOnce again using the piping, group_by(), select(),summarize(), and arrange(), I created a table of the minimum, maximum, range, standard deviation, IQR of number birds for each area, sorted in descending order by range, to look at the dispersion of the data. I also created a boxplot graphing the Number_of_Birds vs. Area to better visualize the data.\n\n\nLooking at this table, the Americas has the 4th largest range of number of birds for all areas in the data frame, at \\~5.8 billion. The USA had the 12th largest range of number birds for all areas at \\~2 billion. The Americas has a minimum number of birds of 553,000, whereas the USA had a 6 times higher minimum number of birds of 3.4 million. While the Americas have a higher maximum number of birds at \\~ 5.8 billion vs USA's maximum number of birds of \\~2 billion, the differences in minimum numbers of birds and range helps explains why the USA has a higher median number of birds than the USA.\n\nLooking at the world -- which had the largest range and IQR for number of birds -- we can see that despite area contributing to the number of birds, there is still a large range in number of birds for each area. This means that area alone cannot explain all of the variation in number_of_birds. Therefore, I decided to look at the relationship between time (as measured by Year) and the number of birds.\n\n**Year and Total Number of Birds**\n\nUsing the piping, group_by(), and summarise() functions, I created a table of the mean and median of the total number of birds grouped by year. I sorted the table descending by mean number of birds to get average data for each year.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Create table of number of birds by year\n\nBirds_Clean %>%\n  group_by(Year)%>%\n  summarise(avg_birds = mean(Number_of_Birds, na.rm = TRUE), med_birds = median(Number_of_Birds, na.rm = TRUE))%>%\n   arrange(desc(avg_birds))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 58 × 3\n    Year  avg_birds med_birds\n   <dbl>      <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1  2018 182869178.   2830500\n 2  2017 179185690.   2764000\n 3  2016 176522797.   2798000\n 4  2015 168025068.   2734500\n 5  2014 163800537.   2687500\n 6  2013 162940899.   2574000\n 7  2012 159889568.   2352000\n 8  2010 158516613.   2200000\n 9  2011 155450242.   2367000\n10  2009 154204552.   2207000\n# … with 48 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at this table, the data follows the expected trend almost perfectly - with time the average total number of birds in a stock increases. The top 10 higher average number of birds in a stock is from the 10 most recent year 2009-2018. In fact, the top 10 average number of birds in a stock is in perfect chronological data, with the exception of more avg_birds in 2011 than 2010. It is clear from this table that over time the average number of birds increases. So while the world will have the largest bird_stock, the world in 2018 will likely have a larger bird stock than the world in 2000.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Graph of Birds by year FAO STAT data\nggplot(Birds_Clean, aes(Year, Number_of_Birds)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() + labs(title = \"Total Number of Birds by Year\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](challenge2_EmmaNarkewicz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Graph of Birds by year FAO STAT data 0-1billion\nggplot(Birds_Clean, aes(Year, Number_of_Birds)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() + ylim(0, 1000000000) + labs(title = \"Total Number of Birds by Year, ylim = 0-1billion\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](challenge2_EmmaNarkewicz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at the above graph of Number_of_Birds vs. Years, it is once again clear that the number of bird stocks increase by time.

Viewing the second graph zoomed in on the y axis from 0-1billion using ylim(), while its its crowded at the bottom of the y-axis but at the top of the graph you can see the trend of number of birds increasing with time (Year).\n\n\n**Item, Year, and Number of Birds**\n\nSo far, I have examined the impact of area and year on number of birds, but not examined the item. To do so I created a table using the pivot_wider() function to examine the average number of birds for each of the 5 types of Item at 2 points of time 50 years apart, 1968 and 2018. I used kable() to rename the column headings and add commas to the data in the table.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#creating a table using the pivot_wider solution modeling the example pivot_wider solution we reviewed in class and using knitr::kable() to add commas and rename the column headings.\nt1<-Birds_Clean %>%\n  filter(Year %in% c(1968, 2018))%>%\n  group_by(Year, Item)%>%\n  summarise(avg_birds = mean(Number_of_Birds, na.rm=TRUE))%>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = c(avg_birds))\n\nknitr::kable(t1,\n             digits=0,format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"),\n             col.names = c(\"Bird Type\", \"Average Birds in 1968\", \"Average Birds in 2018\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Bird Type              | Average Birds in 1968| Average Birds in 2018|\n|:----------------------|---------------------:|---------------------:|\n|Chickens               |            91,003,212|           396,772,130|\n|Ducks                  |             9,166,421|            38,132,814|\n|Geese and guinea fowls |             3,245,371|            19,236,000|\n|Pigeons, other birds   |             2,839,529|             5,484,714|\n|Turkeys                |             7,959,256|            17,288,444|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at the table, for every bird type, the average number of birds increased from 1968 to 2018. In this time span, the average number of chickens increased by 4.36 times, the average number of ducks increased by 4.16 times, the average number of geese and guinea fowls increased by 6.77 times, the average number of pigeons and other birds increased by 1.93 times, and the average number of turkeys increased by 2.17 times. The average number of chickens remains much higher than the other bird types over the 50 years, almost reaching 400 million in 2018. The average number of pigeons and other birds remains relatively low compared to the other bird types, not even reaching 5.5 million birds in 2018. Even when factoring in Item  (Bird Type), the trend of total number of birds increasing over time for a bird stock remains.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy wrangling the FAO STAT bird data in R using dply functions I observed that larger areas generally had larger bird-stocks. Additionally, I observed that bird-stocks increased over time -- even when accounting for different bird types (Item).\n\n\n",
