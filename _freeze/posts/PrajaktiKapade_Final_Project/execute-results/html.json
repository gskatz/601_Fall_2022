Selectors ordered materials with ordering slips, cataloguers manually catalogued sources and indexed them with the card catalog system (in which all bibliographic data was kept on a single index card), fines were collected by local bailiffs, and users signed books out manually, indicating their name on clue cards which were then kept at the circulation desk. \n\nEarly mechanization came in 1936, when the University of Texas began using a punch card system to manage library circulation. While the punch card system allowed for more efficient tracking of loans, library services were far from being integrated, and no other library task was affected by this change. This led to customer dissatisfaction and they wanted to move towards a very systematic way of keeping track, then came in Integrated Library systems, one example of which is my dataset for the final project.\n\nThis system is perfect for all educational institutions that wish to maintain minimum operational costs. The system helps with better management, lesser wastage of time and improves engagement and productivity. With this data, we can analyze the trends about different patrons based on their age, based on the registered year, their renewals and checkouts, and see the circulation trend.\n\nResearch Question : How does Age, Patron type, Branch and Residency affect the patrons, their checkouts and their renewals?\n\nInstalling and importing necessary packages\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#install.packages(\"hrbrthemes\")\n#install.packages(\"viridis\")\n#install.packages('patchwork')\n#install.packages('zoo')\n#install.packages('directlabels')\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.3.5      ✔ purrr   0.3.5 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.4.1 \n✔ readr   2.1.1      ✔ forcats 0.5.1 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(hrbrthemes)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nNOTE: Either Arial Narrow or Roboto Condensed fonts are required to use these themes.\n      Please use hrbrthemes::import_roboto_condensed() to install Roboto Condensed and\n      if Arial Narrow is not on your system, please see https://bit.ly/arialnarrow\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(viridis)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: viridisLite\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(zoo)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'zoo'\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    as.Date, as.Date.numeric\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(directlabels)\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## DATA\n\n### Loading the dataset\n\nThe dataset - SF Integrated Learning System is sourced from Kaggle.com and is composed of bibliographic records including inventoried items, patron records, and circulation data. The data is used in the daily operation of the library, including circulation, online public catalog, cataloging, acquisitions, collection development, processing, and serials control. This dataset represents the usage of inventoried items by patrons (~420K records). It contains data starting from 2003 uptill 2016.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary_dataset <- read_csv(\"_data/Library_Usage.csv\")\nlibrary_dataset\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 423,448 × 15\n   Patron Type…¹ Patro…² Total…³ Total…⁴ Age R…⁵ Home …⁶ Home …⁷ Circu…⁸ Circu…⁹\n           <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>   <chr>   <chr>  \n 1             3 SENIOR       28      13 65 to … X       Main L… Novemb… 2012   \n 2             0 ADULT        21      10 55 to … X       Main L… October 2015   \n 3             0 ADULT       275     559 60 to … X       Main L… January 2015   \n 4             0 ADULT        73      38 45 to … M8      Missio… Februa… 2016   \n 5             0 ADULT       182      90 45 to … X       Main L… July    2016   \n 6             3 SENIOR        1       0 65 to … X       Main L… July    2004   \n 7            16 DIGITA…      31       4 65 to … P7      Potrero January 2012   \n 8             0 ADULT       547     177 60 to … X       Main L… July    2016   \n 9             0 ADULT        28       1 60 to … X       Main L… Decemb… 2015   \n10             0 ADULT        77       3 60 to … X       Main L… July    2016   \n# … with 423,438 more rows, 6 more variables: `Notice Preference Code` <chr>,\n#   `Notice Preference Definition` <chr>, `Provided Email Address` <lgl>,\n#   `Year Patron Registered` <dbl>, `Outside of County` <lgl>,\n#   `Supervisor District` <dbl>, and abbreviated variable names\n#   ¹​`Patron Type Code`, ²​`Patron Type Definition`, ³​`Total Checkouts`,\n#   ⁴​`Total Renewals`, ⁵​`Age Range`, ⁶​`Home Library Code`,\n#   ⁷​`Home Library Definition`, ⁸​`Circulation Active Month`, …\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n### Summary of the dataset\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(library_dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 423448     15\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe dataset contains 423448 records and 15 columns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(library_dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 423,448\nColumns: 15\n$ `Patron Type Code`             <dbl> 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 16, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0,…\n$ `Patron Type Definition`       <chr> \"SENIOR\", \"ADULT\", \"ADULT\", \"ADULT\", \"A…\n$ `Total Checkouts`              <dbl> 28, 21, 275, 73, 182, 1, 31, 547, 28, 7…\n$ `Total Renewals`               <dbl> 13, 10, 559, 38, 90, 0, 4, 177, 1, 3, 9…\n$ `Age Range`                    <chr> \"65 to 74 years\", \"55 to 59 years\", \"60…\n$ `Home Library Code`            <chr> \"X\", \"X\", \"X\", \"M8\", \"X\", \"X\", \"P7\", \"X…\n$ `Home Library Definition`      <chr> \"Main Library\", \"Main Library\", \"Main L…\n$ `Circulation Active Month`     <chr> \"November\", \"October\", \"January\", \"Febr…\n$ `Circulation Active Year`      <chr> \"2012\", \"2015\", \"2015\", \"2016\", \"2016\",…\n$ `Notice Preference Code`       <chr> \"z\", \"z\", \"z\", \"z\", \"z\", \"z\", \"z\", \"p\",…\n$ `Notice Preference Definition` <chr> \"email\", \"email\", \"email\", \"email\", \"em…\n$ `Provided Email Address`       <lgl> TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRU…\n$ `Year Patron Registered`       <dbl> 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 200…\n$ `Outside of County`            <lgl> TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, …\n$ `Supervisor District`          <dbl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe above shows the columns of the dataset along with their datatype and the initial recordings of that particular columns.

No dates prior to 2003  due to system migration.\n\n14. `Outside of County` - If a patron's home address is not in San Francisco, then flagged as true, otherwise false.\n\n15. `Supervisor District` - Based on patron address: San Francisco Supervisor District. Based on the website it suggested that \"This is an automated field, please note that if \"Outside of County\" is true, then there will be no supervisor district. Also, if the input address was not well-formed, the supervisor district will be blank.\"\n\n\n### Renaming the columns\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary_dataset <- library_dataset %>% \n  rename( 'out_of_county' = 'Outside of County', \"patron_type\" = 'Patron Type Definition', \"total_checkouts\" = 'Total Checkouts', \"total_renewals\"= 'Total Renewals', 'age' = 'Age Range', 'branch' = 'Home Library Definition','active_year' = 'Circulation Active Year', 'active_month' = 'Circulation Active Month', 'notice_preference' = 'Notice Preference Definition', 'provided_email' = 'Provided Email Address', 'year_registered' = 'Year Patron Registered', \"outside_of_county\" = 'Outside of County')\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Cleaning the dataset \nSelected the columns with unique characteristic for our visualizations and analysis.

Also, for age range 10-19 years and 20-24 years, there are mostly non-residents who have registered after 2012, while residents are very less.\n\n## REFLECTION\nThis project and working with R has been a learning experience for me as I am a Computer Science student. While starting this project, I thought maybe the San Franciso Library Usage dataset would be very concise, but as I kept diving into the dataset, I realized it has so much information about patrons, the library branches, the age groups and their contributions to checkouts and renewals of books. The Integrated library management dataset gave me some interesting findings.\n\nMy strategy was to understand how each category(column) is affecting the checkouts and renewals, and then if any interesting observation was seen, I would  move forward with digging in more in that direction. For eg: I looked into 2016's data per month and found that July had the most checkouts. I dived in to the July 2016's data to understand who made those checkouts? Which age range and patron type contributed the most to it? This approach made the visualization making process very intriguing for me.\n\nThe dataset had a lot of records, but to incorporate more information on branches I searched through the SF public library website and manually loaded the data to a csv, which I then incorporated in the main dataset. Challenging part was to understand what different fields mean, specially what different year values signify? Also, understanding from whose point of view is this data made and whats the timeline?\n\nI tried to learn, have fun with it, and incorporate all types of plots, specially histograms, density plots and facet_wrap which made it easier to see observations. If we had more information about the data from other parts of California or USA, I could have found trends for a much higher population using these visualizations. Also, we need more information about the branches, as only geographical information was available on the website. Apart from that, some information about the different categories of books, which age groups like which categories more, that would be an interesting research to do.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nStarting from the basics, there were 10 Age ranges varying over 17 Patron Types, 34 branches and over 4 lakh records. The visualizations gave us insights about which Age Range is making the most checkouts and renewals - and it was inspiring to figure out that 10-19, 45-54 and 65-74 age ranges had the maximum checkouts, this implies all generations are interested in issuing books and reading them, which is a great habit. It was also seen that ADULTS and SENIORS had the highest checkouts and renewals, which means they take some time reading it or re-read it, by renewing the books. Comparatively, there are also high renewals for YOUNG ADULTS, students generally tend to issue some books for studying and end up renewing them. Looking at residency, I observed that residents have higher checkouts and renewals than non-residents, but it was interesting to observe that the non-residents patron registration has increased over the coming years, which suggests that the awareness among the people outside the SF county has increased and they are also issuing books now. Lastly, looking at the branches, it was observed that the most checkouts and renewals were made at the Main Library branch, which made sense as Main branch is generally most accessible to patrons.\n\nIt was very clear, that checkouts and renewals were strong correlated, which does make sense intuitively. I showed it using the pearson coefficient in our code above. The plots also reflected that the checkouts and renewals have increased over time, that means people are getting more and more interested in issuing and reading books. Another trend, I noted was related to \"Year of Registry\" and \"Average Checkouts/Average Renewals\", which should intuitively follow a decreasing trend (as people who registered earlier will definitely have more checkouts due to more time), but there was a slight increase in 2007, so that was definitely an anomaly.\n\nFor having a better look into the data, I looked into the latest year's data per month and found that July had the most checkouts. I dived into the July 2016 data and figured they were majorly made by patrons of age 45 and above, and most of them were Staff members or Retired staff. One reason for this could be the holiday season for students, as they do not contribute much towards the checkouts. \n\nUsing the three dimensional plots, we observed that patrons of Digital Access Card type have most registrations for both residents and non-residents, while Retired Staff had most registrations in 2003, with residents having double registrations than non-residents. Also, most patrons of ages 65-74 years registered in 2003, which makes sense as they are old and would have registered earlier. For age range 10-19 years and 20-24 years, there are mostly non-residents who have registered after 2012, while residents are very less. This seems very interesting, and shows people outside SF are also coming to issue books.\n\nAfter so many observations, we still do not know how Age Ranges and Patron Types are related, and will need some more information about them. Also, how are different branches related to each other? Do they share some books? Some more information can lead to better observations and analysis, but all these visualizations on our dataset, were definitely insightful and enlightened me about the SF Integrated Library System.\n\n## BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nRStudio Team (2022).
