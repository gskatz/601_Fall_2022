Then you can read in the data, using either one of the `readr` standard tidy read commands, or a specialized package such as `readxl`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrailroads <- read_csv(\"_data/railroad_2012_clean_county.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAdd any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data sets may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummarize(railroads, mean = mean(total_employees), max = max(total_employees), min = min(total_employees))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n   mean   max   min\n  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1  87.2  8207     1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n##I found the mean, max and min for the total employees column. Meaning that in one county and one state the minimum number of employees working is just 1. For maybe a bigger county, the maximum number of employees 8,207. But taking all the counties (big and small) the average number of employees working is 87.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(railroads$total_employees)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 255432\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## I also found the total number of employees working in every state and every county which is 255,432 people.",
