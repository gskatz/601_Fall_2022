For example, are all time variables correctly coded as dates? Are all string variables reduced and cleaned to sensible categories? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nI have grouped the data based on Product and the Date field, which we have build using Year and Month. It gives the mean and median Price in dollars for each category. As, the points are very less due to lesser categories, it could not be visualized well, but for larger datasets this would work very well.\n\nDocument your work here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproduct_groups<-group_by(abc_data,Product)\nabc_data.p_by_product<-summarise(product_groups,\n          p_mean=mean(Price_Dollar),\n          p_median=median(Price_Dollar),\n          n=n())\nabc_data.p_by_product<-arrange(abc_data.p_by_product,Product)\nhead(abc_data.p_by_product)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  Product        p_mean p_median     n\n  <chr>           <dbl>    <dbl> <int>\n1 B/S Breast       6.55     6.46   120\n2 Bone-in Breast  NA       NA      120\n3 Thighs          NA       NA      120\n4 Whole            2.31     2.35   120\n5 Whole Legs       2.03     2.04   120\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(aes(Product,p_mean),data=abc_data.p_by_product) +\n geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](PrajaktiKapade_challenge4_instructions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndate_groups<-group_by(abc_data,Date)\nabc_data.d_by_product<-summarise(date_groups,\n          p_mean=mean(Price_Dollar),\n          p_median=median(Price_Dollar),\n          n=n())\nabc_data.d_by_product<-arrange(abc_data.d_by_product,Date)\nhead(abc_data.d_by_product)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  Date    p_mean p_median     n\n  <chr>    <dbl>    <dbl> <int>\n1 01-2004  NA       NA        5\n2 01-2005   3.34     2.17     5\n3 01-2006   3.36     2.22     5\n4 01-2007   3.36     2.22     5\n5 01-2008   3.36     2.22     5\n6 01-2009   3.42     2.48     5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(aes(Date,p_mean),data=abc_data.d_by_product) +\n geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](PrajaktiKapade_challenge4_instructions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nAny additional comments?\n",
