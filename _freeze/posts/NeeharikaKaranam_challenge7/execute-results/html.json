And anyone not familiar with Edward Tufte should check out his [fantastic books](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) and [courses on data visualizaton.](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses)\n\n(be sure to only include the category tags for the data you use!)\n\n## Read in data\n\nRead in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.\n\nI have used the same dataset as that of Challenge 6 which is the Debt dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndebt <- read_excel(\"_data/debt_in_trillions.xlsx\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in read_excel(\"_data/debt_in_trillions.xlsx\"): could not find function \"read_excel\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndebt\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'debt' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Briefly describe the data\n\nThe above dataset is about the cumulative debt which is held by some of the nation citizens which are most likely in the US and the dataset consists of 6 rows and 8 columns which explains the different kinds of debts in different quarters Like the auto loan, credit card, student loan.\n\n## Tidy Data (as needed)\n\nThe dataset has a combined column for year and quarter of the US and corresponds to the associated debt spread to all of its citizens for the period. Therefore, I am splitting the year and quarter field.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsplit_quarter_year <-  debt %>%\n  separate(`Year and Quarter`,c('Year','Quarter'),sep = \":\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in separate(., `Year and Quarter`, c(\"Year\", \"Quarter\"), sep = \":\"): object 'debt' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsplit_quarter_year\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'split_quarter_year' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOnce I am done with splitting the column now I am going to pivot the data in order to filter by the debt type. I want to add a new column called the debt_type and debt_percentage and pivot the data. I expect the rows and columns to be 518 and 4 respectively.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npivot_debt<- split_quarter_year%>%\n  pivot_longer(!c(Year,Quarter), names_to = \"Debt_Type\",values_to = \"Debt_Percentage\" )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in pivot_longer(., !c(Year, Quarter), names_to = \"Debt_Type\", values_to = \"Debt_Percentage\"): object 'split_quarter_year' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npivot_debt\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'pivot_debt' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Visualization with Multiple Dimensions\n\nFrom my previous challenge 6 I would like to improve the exploratory analysis graphs to add more dimensionality and add also use the ggplot functionality. \n\nBefore I make changes I would like to first display the original graph.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npivot_debt_plot <- pivot_debt%>%\n  ggplot(mapping=aes(x = Year, y = Debt_Percentage))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in ggplot(., mapping = aes(x = Year, y = Debt_Percentage)): object 'pivot_debt' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npivot_debt_plot + \n  geom_point(aes(color = Debt_Type))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'pivot_debt_plot' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe main objective of the above graph is to display the different debt types and how they are changed throughout the years. I did add a legend, axis and also color codes it feels like except the mortgages and total all of the other values have been lost.\n\nTherefore, I want to improve my chart by adding  a title and also provide more information of the other debt types.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npivot_debt_plot + \n  geom_point(aes(color = Debt_Type))+\n  labs(title = \"Total National Debt of the Mortgages\",subtitle=\"Student and Auto loan are the secondary category\" ,caption = \"From the dataset.\")+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")+\n  facet_zoom(y = Debt_Type == !c(\"Mortgage\",\"Total\"),ylim = c(0,2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'pivot_debt_plot' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe second chart I would like to improve from the third chart of the previous challenge 6. This graph doesn't show anything and without the help of the free scale on each of the axis it makes it very difficult to see the patterns. Therefore, I want to experiment with a lot of them and also give the chart a title as well so as to adjust the axis which will help understanding how the different types of debt flows throughout the year.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npivot_debt_plot+\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~Debt_Type) +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c('03','06','09',12,15,18,21))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'pivot_debt_plot' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npivot_debt_plot+\n  geom_point(aes(color = Quarter,alpha=0.9,)) +\n  facet_wrap(~Debt_Type,scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c('03','06','09',12,15,18,21))+\n  theme_light() +\n  guides(alpha=\"none\") +\n  labs(title = \"Debt Types per year\" ,caption = \"From the dataset.\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'pivot_debt_plot' not found\n```\n:::\n:::",
