Equity in access was measured by the relative CTE participation of 3 student populations that are under represented in STEM careers:\n\n  - Female Students\n  - Students with Disabilities\n  - Racially & Ethnically Diverse Students\n\nThe portion of Perkins V Population data set read in for analysis spanned 52 geographic areas (*50 states, Puerto Rico, & the District of Columbia*), 3 CTE career clusters, 3 under represented student populations, & 7 racial & ethnic categories. \n\nIn the 2020-2021 school year 910,652 US high school students took Health Sciences CTE courses, 898,942 US high school students took IT CTE courses, and 666,222 US high school students took STEM CTE courses.\n \nTo accurately compare racial & ethnic diversity of students in CTE between states, the racial diversity of each state was calculated using US Census Bureau 2020 Decennial Census Data. The Perkins V data set was joined with 2020 Race & Ethnicity Census data for each state. Relative racial & ethnic diversity of state CTE programs was calculated by finding the difference between the state's racial diversity in secondary CTE programs and the state's racial diversity from census data.\n\nThe racial & ethnic categories used were:\n\n - American Indian or Alaskan Native\t\n - Asian\t\n - Black or African American\t\n - Hispanic/Latino\t\n - Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\t\n - White\t\n - Two or More Races\t\n\n## Research Context\n\nCareer & Technical Education (CTE) courses expose students to high demand careers through hands on training. Under the 2018 Strengthening Career & Technical Education (CTE) for the 21st Century Act (*aka Perkins V*), states receive federal funding to provide CTE. States must develop plans for CTE delivery, report on CTE participation & performance, and conduct Comprehensive Needs Assessments (CNAs) on CTE at the local level.\n\nStates have to allocate a portion of their Perkins V funds to recruiting *Special Populations* in CTE - an umbrella category which include students with disabilities (SWDs), and students in fields where less than 25% of individuals are of any gender. Barriers to CTE access for special populations include:\n\n - Lack of Training for CTE Instructors on Working With Students With Disabilities (*i.e. Developing IEPs & Providing Accommodations*)\n - Stigma & Misconceptions About the Capabilities of Students With Disabilities\n - Historical Inequities of Who is Permitted to Participate in STEM Fields \n \nI research equity in access and outcomes for secondary students with disabilities in CTE in my job at UMass Chan Medical School. To quote a policy brief I coauthored, \n  *\"Research shows that CTE coursework in high school provides opportunities to improve employment and post-secondary outcomes for learners with disabilities, CTE has led to higher rates of on-time graduation, and more competitive paid jobs for secondary  students with disabilities\" * (McKay, Ellison, & Narkewicz, 2022)\n\nEven when female students, students with disabilities (SWDs), and racially diverse students are able to access CTE, they may be tracked into lower earning career clusters. The low participation of SWDs, female students, and Black Indigenous & People of Color (BIPOC) students in STEM fields inspired me to focus on CTE course in the IT, STEM, & Health Science career clusters.\n\n## Research Questions\n\n - **RQ1. Did female secondary students equally participate in any CTE course & in STEM, Health Science, & IT career clusters in 2020-2021?**\n    - What states had the highest & lowest female participation in CTE?\n    - Were female students under or over represented in any of the 3 career clusters?\n    \n - **RQ2. What percentage of secondary students with disabilities participated in any CTE course & in STEM, Health Science, & IT career clusters in 2020-2021?**\n    - What states had the highest & lowest participation of students with disabilities in CTE?\n    - Were students with disabilities under or over represented in any of the 3 CTE career clusters?\n   \n- **RQ3. What is the racial & ethnic diversity of secondary CTE students in any CTE course & in STEM, Health Science, & IT career clusters in 2020-2021?**\n  - Was participation in CTE comparable between students of different racial & ethnic groups?\n  - Was participation in STEM, Health, & IT CTE cluster comparable between students of different racial & ethnic groups?\n  - Were there any states where racial or ethnic groups are relatively under represented or over represented?\n  \n *Note: When interpreting answers to these research questions, it is important to note that all data is only for the 2020-2021 school year at the secondary CTE levels. Therefore these findings cannot be generalized to the participation of  all CTE students in any school year.*\n\n\n## Reading In the Data\n\nFor easier visualization & analysis, rows & columns containing demographic categories and CTE career clusters outside the specified variables for analysis were deleted upon read in. Data on students with disabilities at the secondary (high school) level is based on the Individuals with Disabilities & Elementary and Secondary Education Acts (IDEA/ESEA). Rows containing CTE participation data the territory of Palau were not read in as there was not corresponding 2020 census data for this geography. The grand total column was read as neither the gender nor race demographic columns summed to the correct total. More information on the complete Perkins V participation data set can be found in **Appendix A**.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Reading in necessary variables\nCTE_DF <- read_excel(\"_Data/CTE_Enrollment_2020-2021.xlsx\",\n                       skip = 2,\n                     col_names = c(\"State\", \n                                   \"Year\", \n                                   \"Education_Level\",\n                                   \"Demographics\", \n                                   \"Total_CTE_Students\", \n                                   \"Delete_1\", \n                                   \"Delete_2\",\n                                   \"Delete_3\", \n                                   \"Delete_4\", \n                                   \"Delete_5\", \n                                   \"Delete_6\", \n                                   \"Delete_7\",\n                                   \"Health_Science\", \n                                   \"Delete_8\",\n                                   \"Delete_9\", \n                                   \"IT\", \n                                   \"Delete_10\",\n                                   \"Delete_11\", \n                                   \"Delete_12\", \n                                   \"STEM\", \n                                   \"Delete_13\",\n                                   \"Delete_14\")) %>%\n  select(!contains(\"Delete\")) %>%\n  filter(str_detect(`Education_Level`,\"Secondary\")) %>%\n   filter(!str_detect(`Demographics`,\"Male\")) %>%\n   filter(!str_detect(`Demographics`,\"Unknown\")) %>%\n   filter(!str_detect(`Demographics`,\"Individuals from Economically Disadvantaged Families\")) %>%\n   filter(!str_detect(`Demographics`,\"ADA\")) %>%\n   filter(!str_detect(`Demographics`,\"Individuals Preparing for Non-traditional Fields\")) %>%\n  filter(!str_detect(`Demographics`,\"English Learners\")) %>%\n   filter(!str_detect(`Demographics`,\"Single Parents\")) %>%\n   filter(!str_detect(`Demographics`,\"Out of Workforce Individuals\")) %>%\n   filter(!str_detect(`Demographics`,\"Homeless Individuals\")) %>%\n   filter(!str_detect(`Demographics`, \"Youth In Foster Care\")) %>%\n   filter(!str_detect(`Demographics`, \"Youth with Parent in Active Military\")) %>%\n  filter(!str_detect(`Demographics`, \"Migrant Students\")) %>%\n  filter(!str_detect(`State`, \"Palau\")) \n```\n:::\n\n**Below is the Perkins V CTE data set after read in:**\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Emma_Narkewicz_Final-Project_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_bd05f3e2cf3132d15d26a6ec4c675e7b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nCTE_DF\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 520 × 8\n   State  Year      Education_Level Demographics     Total…¹ Healt…² IT    STEM \n   <chr>  <chr>     <chr>           <chr>            <chr>   <chr>   <chr> <chr>\n 1 Alaska 2020-2021 Secondary       Grand Total      8249    1956    1528  1406 \n 2 Alaska 2020-2021 Secondary       Female           3400    1074    627   590  \n 3 Alaska 2020-2021 Secondary       American Indian… 1366    334     150   172  \n 4 Alaska 2020-2021 Secondary       Asian            495     73      105   54   \n 5 Alaska 2020-2021 Secondary       Black or Africa… 164     38      27    18   \n 6 Alaska 2020-2021 Secondary       Hispanic/Latino  590     118     116   89   \n 7 Alaska 2020-2021 Secondary       Native Hawaiian… 205     18      22    14   \n 8 Alaska 2020-2021 Secondary       White            4421    1153    931   880  \n 9 Alaska 2020-2021 Secondary       Two or More Rac… 1008    222     177   179  \n10 Alaska 2020-2021 Secondary       Individuals Wit… 989     233     201   175  \n# … with 510 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​Total_CTE_Students,\n#   ²​Health_Science\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Tidying & Mutating Data\n\nThe original CTE data set was neither tidy nor easy to read. To compare the diversity in CTE between states & career clusters, my unit of analysis will be the population of secondary students in CTE for the year 2020-2021, in a state, in a specific CTE cluster, with a specific demographic identity (race, gender, disability).\n\n### Objectives of Tidying Data:\n  \n - Removed redundant Year & Education Level columns as all data is for Secondary level students in the 2020-2021 year\n\n - Used pivot_longer() to  combine the 3 CTE clusters & 1 state columns into 1 categorical Career Cluster column & 1 column of students counts\n \n - Converted the number of students column from character type to numeric type using parse_number()\n \n - Used pivot_wider() to separate out gender, race, and disability variables from the Demographics column into distinct columns\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Remove redundant columns\nTidy_CTE_DF <- CTE_DF %>%\n  select(!contains(\"Year\")) %>%\n  select(!contains(\"Level\")) %>%\n#Pivot Longer to Condense Career Clusters, also convert number of students to numeric type\n  pivot_longer(cols = \"Total_CTE_Students\": \"STEM\", \n               names_to = \"Career Cluster\",\n               values_to = \"Number of Students\") %>%\n  mutate(across(any_of(c(\"Number of Students\")), \n                parse_number)) %>%\n#Pivot wider demographic variables\npivot_wider(names_from = \"Demographics\", values_from = \"Number of Students\")\n\nTidy_CTE_DF\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 208 × 12\n   State    Career…¹ Grand…² Female Ameri…³ Asian Black…⁴ Hispa…⁵ Nativ…⁶  White\n   <chr>    <chr>      <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1 Alaska   Total_C…    8249   3400    1366   495     164     590     205   4421\n 2 Alaska   Health_…    1956   1074     334    73      38     118      18   1153\n 3 Alaska   IT          1528    627     150   105      27     116      22    931\n 4 Alaska   STEM        1406    590     172    54      18      89      14    880\n 5 Alabama  Total_C…  351521 191867    8864  4556  109087   31279     661 189561\n 6 Alabama  Health_…   26687  15305     802   511    7421    2150      63  15043\n 7 Alabama  IT          6635   2115      80   272    2000     552      19   3491\n 8 Alabama  STEM        4037    824     129   130     745     380      17   2507\n 9 Arkansas Total_C…  113868  55174     713  1789   20747   14869     906  71771\n10 Arkansas Health_…   23917  15685     146   494    4147    3161     161  15126\n# … with 198 more rows, 2 more variables: `Two or More Races` <dbl>,\n#   `Individuals With Disabilities (ESEA/IDEA)` <dbl>, and abbreviated variable\n#   names ¹​`Career Cluster`, ²​`Grand Total`,\n#   ³​`American Indian or Alaskan Native`, ⁴​`Black or African American`,\n#   ⁵​`Hispanic/Latino`, ⁶​`Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander`\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe tidy CTE data set hax dimensions of 208 x 12. There were 2 categorical columns (*State, Career Cluster*) & 10 numerical columns (*The Grand Total of Students, Female Students, Students w/ Disabilities & the 7 columns for students counts of each of the 7 Race & Ethnicity Categories*)\n\n  - The 7 Race & Ethnicity Categories:\n    - American Indian or Alaskan Native \n    - Asian\n    - Black or African American\n    - Hispanic/Latino\n    - Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\n    - White\n    - Two or More Races\n\nLeaving racial data in un-pivoted format at this time allowed for the visualization of differences in CTE participation between states & CTE career clusters using  US heat maps & facet_wrap.\n\n### Converting Counts to Percentages\n\nTo appropriately compare diversity in CTE participation between states of different population sizes I:\n\n - Converted counts of CTE students of each identity to percentages using mutate() and division by the grand total number of all secondary CTE students in the state\n\n - Removed counts from data frame for easier work with percentages\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Converting participation from counts to percentages\nCTE_Data_Percentage <- Tidy_CTE_DF %>%\n  mutate(Percent_Female = round((`Female`/`Grand Total`)*100)) %>%\n  mutate(Percent_Disabilities= round((`Individuals With Disabilities (ESEA/IDEA)`/`Grand Total`)*100)) %>%\n  mutate (Percent_AmInd_AL_Ntv= round((`American Indian or Alaskan Native`/`Grand Total`)*100)) %>%\n  mutate (Percent_Asian= round((`Asian`/`Grand Total`)*100)) %>%\n  mutate (Percent_Black= round((`Black or African American`/`Grand Total`)*100)) %>%\n  mutate (Percent_Hispanic= round((`Hispanic/Latino`/`Grand Total`)*100)) %>%\n  mutate (Percent_NtvHI_PacIsld= round((`Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander`/`Grand Total`)*100)) %>%\n  mutate(Percent_White= round((`White`/`Grand Total`)*100)) %>%\n  mutate(Percent_TwoMoreRaces= round((`Two or More Races`/`Grand Total`)*100)) %>%\n  rename(\"Delete1\" = \"Female\") %>%\n  rename(\"Delete2\" = \"American Indian or Alaskan Native\") %>%\n  rename(\"Delete3\" = \"Asian\") %>%\n  rename(\"Delete4\" = \"Black or African American\") %>%\n  rename(\"Delete5\" = \"Hispanic/Latino\") %>%\n  rename(\"Delete6\" = \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\") %>%\n  rename(\"Delete7\" = \"White\") %>%\n  rename(\"Delete8\" = \"Two or More Races\") %>%\n  rename(\"Delete9\" = \"Individuals With Disabilities (ESEA/IDEA)\") %>%\n  select(!contains(\"Delete\"))\n\n#Remove Nebraska N/A STEM row before combining with census data\nCTE_Data_Percentage <- CTE_Data_Percentage %>%\n  drop_na()\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Calculating Relative Racial Diversity Using tidycensus & Join \n\nTo calculate relative racial diversity of students participating in CTE I:\n\n - Obtained an API Key from the US Census Bureau to access census data\n \n - Identified appropriate race & data census variables from the 2020 decennial census using the tidy_census() package and load_variable() function \n \n -  Created a data frame with the desired race & ethnicity variables & inherit geometry for future mapping using the get_decennial() function\n \n - Pivoted census data wider to create columns for each racial group\n \n - Converted census race data from counts to percentages and removed count columns\n \n - Left joined CTE percentage data to the racial census percentage data by State\n \n - Calculated relative CTE racial diversity in a state using the formula **Delta RaceX  CTE = (% of High Students in State CTE who are of X Race) -

Targeted recruitment efforts should be made to increase male participation in Health Science (**71% female**), & female participation in STEM (**27% female**) & IT courses (**37% female**)\n\nStudents with Disabilities represented **11%** of all high school students in CTE nationwide in 2020-2021, roughly proportional to the estimated *~ 15%* of students ages 3-21 with disabilities (NCES, 2020). Targeted recruitment & accommodations should be made to increase the participation of students with disabilities in Health Science (**6% SwD**) & STEM courses (**8% SwD**). Students with disabilities were over represented in some Northeast states, which bears further research on if SWDs are being tracked into certain CTE career clusters in those states.\n\nStudents participating in high school CTE courses in 2020-2021 were more racially & ethnically diverse (**non-White**) than Census data. Only **46%** of high school students in CTE were White in the 2020-2021 year,compared to **61%** of 2020 US Census participants. Program wide, Black & Hispanic high students were relatively over-represented in CTE courses compared to census data, while White, Asian & high students of Two or More Races were relatively under represented in CTE. \n\nHowever, by career cluster, a lower percentage of Hispanic students participated in IT & STEM courses than in the Health Sciences or any CTE course. In contrast, a higher percentage of White & Asian students participated in  STEM & IT courses than any CTE course in the 2020-2021 year. A higher percentage of Black students participated in IT than in STEM career clusters. This highlights how high relative participation of racially & ethnically diverse students in CTE does not always equal consistent high participation of these racial & ethnic diverse student in high earning potential STEM career clusters.\n\n\n### Limitation & Areas for Future Work  \n\nA key limitation of this project was the limited scope of the Perkins V data read in & analyzed.CTE data only was for 2020-2021 program year & only participation data was read in. Future analysis should compare changes in CTE participation over time by reading in Perkins V data from year prior to 2020-2021 school years. Perkins V performance data can be analyzed in addition to Perkins V participation data to examine equity in both access and outcomes in CTE. Additionally, there are many other CTE special populations & career clusters that should also be analyzed for equitable access (**see Appendix A**).\n\nFor states where a student group was relatively \"over\" or \"under\" represented, further research should be conducted what barriers contribute to inequity in participation & how participation in CTE breaks down by career cluster. Having a third of students with disabilities participating in CTE course could mean an innovative program accommodating SWDs in in-demand career pathways *OR* that SWDs are being tracked into low-earning career pathways with little autonomy. More information is needed to assess what is actually occurring, & if it is good or bad for students.\n\nLastly, on a technical note, an area for future growth would be to write & replace areas of my code with more efficient and widely applicable functions. This would be particularly useful for future analysis reading in multiple Census & Perkins V data sets of the same structure but for different years. \n\n### Reflection\n\nThis DACSS 601 course was my first time even coding ever and learning R, & while my coding skills are still rudimentary, I am very proud of what I was able to accomplish in this course & final project. During Challenge 5, I struggled for days to create  a single US Map visual. I became very comfortable working with map data on this final project & also I also joined two data sets & learned to use the tidycensus() package for this project, both new skills that would have terrified me a few weeks ago.\n\nI enjoyed seeing how I can use R to clean, analyze, and present data sets, including the Perkins V data I use in some work projects. Coding as a beginner has been an emotional roller coaster, but I am hopeful to apply this new found DACSS 601 learning to cleaning data creating research & policy briefs in R. \n\n## References\n\nAdvance CTE.
