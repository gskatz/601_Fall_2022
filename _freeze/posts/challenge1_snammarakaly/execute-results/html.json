Then you can read in the data, using either one of the `readr` standard tidy read commands, or a specialized package such as `readxl`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl)\nwild_birdData<-read_excel(\"_data/wild_bird_data.xlsx\",skip=1)\nwild_birdData\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 146 × 2\n   `Wet body weight [g]` `Population size`\n                   <dbl>             <dbl>\n 1                  5.46           532194.\n 2                  7.76          3165107.\n 3                  8.64          2592997.\n 4                 10.7           3524193.\n 5                  7.42           389806.\n 6                  9.12           604766.\n 7                  8.04           192361.\n 8                  8.70           250452.\n 9                  8.89            16997.\n10                  9.52              595.\n# … with 136 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAdd any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data sets may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n\n\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n##Dimensions and Data Extraction\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(wild_birdData)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 146   2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe given data is in the form of excel and is read using the readxl library. The data is stored in wild_birdData. The first row of the actual dataset shows reference and from where the data is being extracted which is not relevant for our study. Hence, the first row is skipped. The dataset consists of two columns 'bodyweight' and 'population_size'. The dimensions of the dataset is [146,2].\n\n#null check\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nis.null(wild_birdData)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(wild_birdData)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n Wet body weight [g] Population size  \n Min.   :   5.459    Min.   :      5  \n 1st Qu.:  18.620    1st Qu.:   1821  \n Median :  69.232    Median :  24353  \n Mean   : 363.694    Mean   : 382874  \n 3rd Qu.: 309.826    3rd Qu.: 198515  \n Max.   :9639.845    Max.   :5093378  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe wild birds dataset consists of two columns or attributes 'Wet body Weight' and 'Population Size'. We have checked that there are no null values in the dataset. If we have null values in the data set we need to preprocess it before going to further evaluations. Moreover, the birds with less body weight are low in number and the birds that are heavier are greater in number. From this we can infer that the population of the birds are directly proportional to their body weight. All the other statistical information about the dataset is shown above.",
