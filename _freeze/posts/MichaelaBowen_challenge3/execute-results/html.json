Upon observsation, I noticed there were 6 variables. We can see that the amount and size of eggs(L,XL, Dozen or Half Dozen) are determined by the independent variables month and year. The data ranges from January of 2004 to December of 2013. I plant to pivot the data set longer in order to group by month, year or type of product. This way I can get means, averages, standard deviations, etc on the amount produces based on a certain timeframe.\n\n## Anticipate the End Result\n\nThe first step in pivoting the data is to try to come up with a concrete vision of what the end product *should* look like - that way you will know whether or not your pivoting was successful.\n\nOne easy way to do this is to think about the dimensions of your current data (tibble, dataframe, or matrix), and then calculate what the dimensions of the pivoted data should be.\n\nSuppose you have a dataset with $n$ rows and $k$ variables. In our example, 3 of the variables are used to identify a case, so you will be pivoting $k-3$ variables into a longer format where the $k-3$ variable names will move into the `names_to` variable and the current values in each of those columns will move into the `values_to` variable. Therefore, we would expect $n * (k-3)$ rows in the pivoted dataframe!\n\n\n\n### Challenge: Pivot the Chosen Data\n\nDocument your work here. What will a new \"case\" be once you have pivoted the data? How does it meet requirements for tidy data?\n\nBelow are the expected dimensions after pivoting the eggs_tidy data. The new variables \"l/xl_half/whole_dozens\", and \"dozens_quantity\" are more helpful in determining information from this dataset. Each case is now determined by year and month, and the size and quantity of the produce depend on those specific variables. It is now easier to group by time, and type of product as well.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#existing rows\nnrow(eggs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 120\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#existing columns\nncol(eggs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 6\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#dataframe dimensions algorithm\n#expected rows\nnrow(eggs) * ((ncol(eggs)-2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 480\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#expected columns\n2+4\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 6\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#pivoting data\npivot_longer(eggs, cols = c(\"large_half_dozen\",\"large_dozen\",\"extra_large_half_dozen\",\"extra_large_dozen\"),\n               names_to = \"l/xl_half/whole_dozens\",\n               values_to = \"dozens_quantity\"\n               )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 480 √ó 4\n   month     year `l/xl_half/whole_dozens` dozens_quantity\n   <chr>    <dbl> <chr>                              <dbl>\n 1 January   2004 large_half_dozen                    126 \n 2 January   2004 large_dozen                         230 \n 3 January   2004 extra_large_half_dozen              132 \n 4 January   2004 extra_large_dozen                   230 \n 5 February  2004 large_half_dozen                    128.\n 6 February  2004 large_dozen                         226.\n 7 February  2004 extra_large_half_dozen              134.\n 8 February  2004 extra_large_dozen                   230 \n 9 March     2004 large_half_dozen                    131 \n10 March     2004 large_dozen                         225 \n# ‚Ä¶ with 470 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neggs\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 120 √ó 6\n   month      year large_half_dozen large_dozen extra_large_half_dozen extra_l‚Ä¶¬π\n   <chr>     <dbl>            <dbl>       <dbl>                  <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1 January    2004             126         230                    132       230 \n 2 February   2004             128.        226.                   134.      230 \n 3 March      2004             131         225                    137       230 \n 4 April      2004             131         225                    137       234.\n 5 May        2004             131         225                    137       236 \n 6 June       2004             134.        231.                   137       241 \n 7 July       2004             134.        234.                   137       241 \n 8 August     2004             134.        234.                   137       241 \n 9 September  2004             130.        234.                   136.      241 \n10 October    2004             128.        234.                   136.      241 \n# ‚Ä¶ with 110 more rows, and abbreviated variable name ¬π‚Äãextra_large_dozen\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#new dimensions of the eggs data\ndim(eggs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 120   6\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nAfter reading in the tidy eggs data I attempted to read in the excel eggs data. Below I have renamed the columns, separated month and year into separate columns and pivoted the data longer to create the new columns: size, quantity and price. After visually analyzing the data I noted there was a typo in the \"date\" column. I removed this typo and proceeded with pivoting the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\norganiceggpoultry <- read_excel(\"_data/organiceggpoultry.xls\",\n                                sheet = \"Data\",\n                                range = cell_limits(c(6,2),c(NA,6)),\n                                col_names = c(\"date\", \"extralarge_dozen\", \"extralarge_halfdozen\",\"large_dozen\", \"large_halfdozen \"))%>%\n  mutate(\n    date = str_remove(date, \"/1\")\n  )%>%\n  #split month/year variables\n  separate(\"date\", into = c(\"month\",\"year\"))%>%\n  fill(\"year\")%>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = contains(\"dozen\"),\n              names_to = c(\"size\",\"quantity\"),\n              names_sep = \"_\",\n              values_to = \"price\")\nsummary(organiceggpoultry)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    month               year               size             quantity        \n Length:480         Length:480         Length:480         Length:480        \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n     price      \n Min.   :126.0  \n 1st Qu.:174.5  \n Median :206.6  \n Mean   :210.1  \n 3rd Qu.:267.5  \n Max.   :290.0  \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nView(organiceggpoultry)\n```\n:::\n",
