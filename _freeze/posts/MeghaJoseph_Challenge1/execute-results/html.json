Then you can read in the data, using either one of the `readr` standard tidy read commands, or a specialized package such as `readxl`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf<-read_csv(\"_data/cereal.csv\")\ndf\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 20 × 4\n   Cereal                Sodium Sugar Type \n   <chr>                  <dbl> <dbl> <chr>\n 1 Frosted Mini Wheats        0    11 A    \n 2 Raisin Bran              340    18 A    \n 3 All Bran                  70     5 A    \n 4 Apple Jacks              140    14 C    \n 5 Captain Crunch           200    12 C    \n 6 Cheerios                 180     1 C    \n 7 Cinnamon Toast Crunch    210    10 C    \n 8 Crackling Oat Bran       150    16 A    \n 9 Fiber One                100     0 A    \n10 Frosted Flakes           130    12 C    \n11 Froot Loops              140    14 C    \n12 Honey Bunches of Oats    180     7 A    \n13 Honey Nut Cheerios       190     9 C    \n14 Life                     160     6 C    \n15 Rice Krispies            290     3 C    \n16 Honey Smacks              50    15 A    \n17 Special K                220     4 A    \n18 Wheaties                 180     4 A    \n19 Corn Flakes              200     3 A    \n20 Honeycomb                210    11 C    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\nAdd any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data sets may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nIn total, we have 80 entries in this data set which talks about different cereals with 20 rows and 4 columns. The column categories are cereal with string variable, sodium and sugar with integer variable and type with character variable.It talks about the sodium level and sugar content present in each type of cereal and categories it into either A or C type The data set has been checked for null and missing values and there are no such values present and the data set is clean.\n\n",
