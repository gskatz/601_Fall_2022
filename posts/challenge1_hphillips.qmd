## Overview

Below please find my overview of the railroad dataset from 2012:  

-   railroad_2012_clean_county.csv ‚≠ê

## Code to read data
```{r}
railroadclean<-read_csv("_data/railroad_2012_clean_county.csv")

```


## Summary

We see that there are three variables in this table: state, county and total employees.  

The data seems to be tabulating the number of railroad employees in each county.  

We can see that the largest employment number in a county is 8207 (in Cook County Illinois) and the smallest is one (which happens in 145 counties). With such a wide range it is useful, perhaps, to look at the median which is 21 people.
