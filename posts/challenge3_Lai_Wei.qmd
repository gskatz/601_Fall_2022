```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

```

## Challenge Overview

Today's challenge is to:

1.  read in a data set, and describe the data set using both words and any supporting information (e.g., tables, etc)
2.  identify what needs to be done to tidy the current data
3.  anticipate the shape of pivoted data
4.  pivot the data into tidy format using `pivot_longer`

## Read in data

Read in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.

-   animal_weights.csv ⭐
-   eggs_tidy.csv ⭐⭐ or organiceggpoultry.xls ⭐⭐⭐
-   australian_marriage\*.xls ⭐⭐⭐
-   USA Households\*.xlsx ⭐⭐⭐⭐
-   sce_labor_chart_data_public.xlsx 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

```{r}
Households <- read_excel("_data/USA Households by Total Money Income, Race, and Hispanic Origin of Householder 1967 to 2019.xlsx",
                         skip = 5,
                         col_names = c("Year","Household","Total",str_c("income",1:9,sep = "_i"),"Median_income","MarginOfError","Mean_income","MarginOfError"))
Households
```
Read the data and rename the columns. 

### Briefly describe the data
Existing the number of rows
```{r}
nrow(Households)
```
There are 383 statistics in different years in total. 

### Challenge: Describe the final dimensions

```{r}
Households %>% 
  filter(Year%in%c(2007,2017)) 
```
Use the filter() to get the information in 2007 and 2017.

## Pivot the Data

Now we will pivot the data, and compare our pivoted data dimensions to the dimensions calculated above as a "sanity" check.

### Pivot_Wider

```{r}
Households %>% 
  filter(Year%in%2018) %>% 
  select(Household,Year,Median_income) %>% 
  pivot_wider(values_from = Median_income ,names_from = Year)
```
By using pivot_wider() function, we can get a new table that showing in year 2018, how much each household have in the median range.
