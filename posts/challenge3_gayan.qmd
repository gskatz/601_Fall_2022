```{r}

```

## Challenge Overview

Today's challenge is to:

1.  read in a data set, and describe the data set using both words and any supporting information (e.g., tables, etc)
2.  identify what needs to be done to tidy the current data
3.  anticipate the shape of pivoted data
4.  pivot the data into tidy format using `pivot_longer`

## Read in data

Read in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.

-   animal_weights.csv ⭐
-   eggs_tidy.csv ⭐⭐ or organiceggpoultry.xls ⭐⭐⭐
-   australian_marriage\*.xls ⭐⭐⭐
-   USA Households\*.xlsx ⭐⭐⭐⭐
-   sce_labor_chart_data_public.xlsx 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

```{r}
animal_weights <-  read_csv("_data/animal_weight.csv")
animal_weights
```
```{r}
animal_weights %>% 
  summary()
```
```{r}
 railroad<-read_excel("_data/StateCounty2012.xls",
                     skip = 4,
                     col_names= c("state", "delete",  "county",
                                  "delete", "employees")) %>% 
  select(!contains("delete"))%>%
  filter(!str_detect(state, "Total"))

railroad<-head(railroad, -2)%>%
  mutate(county = ifelse(state=="CANADA", "CANADA", county))

railroad
```

### Briefly describe the data

This data set contains information on different types on animals in 9 different parts of the world. 

## Anticipate the End Result

```{r}
#existing rows/cases
nrow(animal_weights)

#existing columns/cases
ncol(animal_weights)
```

There are 9 locations around the world and 16 animals. so when pivoted we should expect 144 rows in the new table. There should be 3 columns. IPCC area, farm_animal and weight 


## Pivot the Data

```{r}
animal_weight_long <-pivot_longer(animal_weights, col = -`IPCC Area`,
                 names_to="farm_animal",
                 values_to = "weight")
animal_weight_long
```


This confirms our previous estimation of our results.
