# Introduction


![Global Government spending(current USD), Size correlates with Share of GDP](GovSpend_VS_RawUSD.gif)

## Data choice overview

I initially chose this data set because recent events abroad have
certainly escalated a global fear of war and I wanted to see how the
tides of military spending ebbed and flowed over the course of recent
history. The more I cleaned the data and played around with
visualizations, the more questions I had. I am excited to see what sort
of trends come from analyzing this data set.

I plan to show how different countries and regions value military
spending and how that value changes over the course of time. Ideally I
will be able to explain patterns in what I see with global or locally
important historic events. How did the US spending change after 9/11 or
more recently did we see anyone bolstering their defenses before news
broke of the Russian invasion of Ukraine? How did spending change
globally after the first and then second world war? While I am not a
statistical expert and will not be able to refute a causation vs
correlation argument, visualizations of these events and the
corresponding spending patterns will still be interesting and hopefully
provoking of conversation.

## Data

### Description

Below is a list of the available sheets in the SIPRI military spending
data export. A few of the tabs are the same base information altered to
reflect a specific currency or ratio. I am choosing to use the "Current
USD" as my source of raw spending numbers as I believe it to be the
easiest to understand and relate to. I will also be using "share of GDP"
as well as "Share of Govt. spending" to provide context around a nations
spending compared to their population they intend on defending as well
as compared to overall spending. The Constant (2020) USD values are all in Millions. 

There will be NA's throughout the dataset which represent the fact that the data was unavailable at that time. This could mean that the country did not exist in that year or they were unwilling to share their military spending information with SIPRI and so the NAs have been left in to reflect that fact. Data exists for at least one country from 1949 to 2021. There are 173 total countries in the database with the full list as well as some additional information in the appendix.

"Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of
all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders
in a specific time period." - Investopedia

```{r}
sheets <- excel_sheets("_data/SIPRI-Milex-data-1949-2021.xlsx")
sheets

```



### Source

The Military spending information I am analyzing comes from **SIPRI**,
the **S**tockholm **I**nternational **P**eace **R**esearch
**I**nstitute. SIPRI was established in 1966 for the purpose of
"research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament". The
organization is funded by the Swedish government however it regularly
works internationally with research centers around the globe. SIPRI
collected this particular data set from the official reports of each of
the included governments in the form of official publications such as
public budgets.

Here is a peek at what the raw information looks like.

```{r message=FALSE,R.options= (tibble.max_extra_cols=0)}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
rawrawData_ShareOfGovSpend <- read_excel("_data/SIPRI-Milex-data-1949-2021.xlsx",sheet=sheets[9])
#knitr::kable(head(rawrawData_ShareOfGovSpend,10),"simple")
head(rawrawData_ShareOfGovSpend,10)

```

# Input and Cleaning

## Reading in raw information

The data provided by the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute(SIPRI) was separated into multiple tabs in one excel .xlsx
file.

In order to begin working I imported the tabs I planned to utilize,
skipping over some of the notes and title rows at the start of each tab.

```{r}
rawData_CurrentUSD <- read_excel("_data/SIPRI-Milex-data-1949-2021.xlsx",sheet=sheets[6],skip=5)
rawData_ShareOfGDP <- read_excel("_data/SIPRI-Milex-data-1949-2021.xlsx",sheet=sheets[7],skip=5)
rawData_ShareOfGovSpend <- read_excel("_data/SIPRI-Milex-data-1949-2021.xlsx",sheet=sheets[9],skip=7)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# output
#head(rawData_CurrentUSD)
#head(rawData_ShareOfGDP)
#head(rawData_ShareOfGovSpend)
```

Next I delete the first row of NA as well as the Notes column for each
tibble.

```{r}
rawData_CurrentUSD <- rawData_CurrentUSD[-1,]  %>%
  select(-Notes)
rawData_ShareOfGDP <- rawData_ShareOfGDP[-1,] %>%
  select(-Notes)
rawData_ShareOfGovSpend <- rawData_ShareOfGovSpend[-1,] %>%
  select(-2:-3)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#head(rawData_CurrentUSD)
#head(rawData_ShareOfGDP)
#head(rawData_ShareOfGovSpend)  
```

## Tidying Data

Before pivoting my data I wanted to add a column for region. I chose to
do this with an algorithm as an exercise in iteration however it would
have been more practical to just hard code this column.

The list of countries where there are NA's for every year:

```{r}
Regions <- rawData_CurrentUSD %>%
  filter(is.na(`1949`))%>%
  select(Country)

Regions
```

You will notice that some of these are continents and sub-continents, I
wanted to break these into a `Region` field. The pattern I saw and chose
to exploit was the fact that the overarching category would always be
followed with a more specific category such as the **Africa** followed
by **North Africa** values (see earlier print outs to see raw
information).

I then added an empty vector into the tibble and populated it according
to the Country column using the pattern described above.

Once I had left flags in the region column dictating where each region
was starting I could use `fill(Region)` in order to populate the rest of
the column.

```{r}
emptyRegionCol <- as.numeric(vector(mode = "character",length = length(rawData_CurrentUSD$`1949`)))## doing as numeric here as a hacky way to fill this with NA's, any better way?

#adding col to tibble to be populated later
mutated_CurrentUSD <- rawData_CurrentUSD %>%
  mutate(Region =emptyRegionCol,.before=2)

# replacing the empty char in region with actual region if 2 NAs appear in a row
  #iterates along the indices of the Country vector
for(i in seq_along(mutated_CurrentUSD$Country) ){
   #if 2 nas in a row then do something
  if(is.na(mutated_CurrentUSD$`1949`[i]) && is.na(mutated_CurrentUSD$`1949`[i+1]) ){
    mutated_CurrentUSD$Region[i+1] <- mutated_CurrentUSD$Country[i+1] #this works because when referencing an index outside of the vector R will return NA - Great to know.
  }
  #if the row is a region
  if(is.na(mutated_CurrentUSD$`1949`[i]) ){
     mutated_CurrentUSD$Region[i+1] <- mutated_CurrentUSD$Country[i]
  }
}

mutated_CurrentUSD <- mutated_CurrentUSD %>%
  fill(Region)

head(mutated_CurrentUSD)
```

Now that I had my proof of concept for cleaning one of the sheets, in a
format I wanted, it was time to clean the other sheets as well. I could
have taken the above code and modified it to work for each of the
other tabs individually however I took the opportunity to practice with
functions and created the below function to clean any of the tabs once
they were loaded in and lightly pre-processed.

## Clean and format function

```{r}
## creating a function to clean the other sheets
##Input: a partially cleaned tibble, must have been read in and had excess rows trimmed
##output: tibble with regions correctly labeled and umbrella region categories i.e Africa above south Africa removed
##Note: All sub categories contained the main category name in them, will use regex to create groupings in the future.
CleanData <- function(inSheet){
  emptyRegionCol <- as.numeric(vector(mode = "character",length = nrow(select(inSheet,2))))

  #adding col to tibble to be populated later
  output <- inSheet %>%
    mutate(Region = emptyRegionCol,.before=2)


  # replacing the empty char in region with actual region if 2 NAs appear in a row
    #iterates along the indices of the Country vector
  for(i in seq_along(output$Country)){
  
    if(is.na(output[[i,3]]) && is.na(output[[(i+1),3]]))
      output$Region[i+1] <- output$Country[i+1]
    
    if(is.na(output[[i,3]]))
       output$Region[i+1] <- output$Country[i]
  }
  
  output <- output %>%
    fill(Region)
  
  
  # removing header rows
  output <- output %>%
    filter(!is.na(output[[3]]))
}

```

Below I call the function on each of the tibbles loaded in earlier. For
the sake of space I will only show one tab being cleaned.

Before:

```{r echo=FALSE}
#head(rawData_CurrentUSD)
#head(rawData_ShareOfGDP)
head(rawData_ShareOfGovSpend)
```

```{r}
Cleaned_currentUSD <- CleanData(rawData_CurrentUSD)
Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend <- CleanData(rawData_ShareOfGovSpend)
Cleaned_ShareOfGDP <- CleanData(rawData_ShareOfGDP)
```

After:
```{r echo=FALSE}
#head(Cleaned_currentUSD)
#head(Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend)
head(Cleaned_ShareOfGDP)

```

## Pivoting and Restructuring

### Pivot and Notation Changes

Next I pivot the years, it should be noted that both the pivoting and
Converting of notation could be handled by the clean function above, i
kept the steps separate so that I could show the progression of the
dataframe.

I must also handle the xxx and ... notations. From the information page
of my data set I can see that the notation is described as follows:

| Raw Notation | Meaning                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| ...          | Data unavailable                                                                        |
| xxx          | Country did not exist or was not independent during all or part of the year in question |

For now I think I will just keep both as NA but will save this form of
the information for future use.

After pivot and notation changes:

```{r}
Cleaned_currentUSD <- Cleaned_currentUSD %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=3:ncol(Cleaned_currentUSD),names_to = "Year",values_drop_na = FALSE)%>%
    na_if("...") %>%
      na_if("xxx")
  
Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend <- Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=3:ncol(Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend),names_to = "Year",values_drop_na = FALSE)%>%
    na_if("...") %>%
      na_if("xxx")

Cleaned_ShareOfGDP <- Cleaned_ShareOfGDP %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=3:ncol(Cleaned_ShareOfGDP),names_to = "Year",values_drop_na = FALSE)%>%
    na_if("...") %>%
      na_if("xxx")


df1<-head(Cleaned_currentUSD)
df2<-head(Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend)
df3<-head(Cleaned_ShareOfGDP)


#df1
#df2
# share of GDP
#df3


```

### Converting Column Types

Finally I will convert the column types to their correct representation.

```{r}
#Year to Number
Cleaned_currentUSD$Year<-as.integer(Cleaned_currentUSD$Year)
Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend$Year<-as.integer(Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend$Year)
Cleaned_ShareOfGDP$Year<-as.integer(Cleaned_ShareOfGDP$Year)

# value to double
Cleaned_currentUSD$value <- as.numeric(Cleaned_currentUSD$value)
Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend$value<- as.numeric(Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend$value)
Cleaned_ShareOfGDP$value<- as.numeric(Cleaned_ShareOfGDP$value)
```



```{r echo=FALSE}
Cleaned_currentUSD <- Cleaned_currentUSD %>%
  rename(MilitarySpend_currentUSD=value)

Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend <- Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend%>%
  rename(MilitarySpend_ShareofGovSpend=value)

Cleaned_ShareOfGDP <- Cleaned_ShareOfGDP%>%
  rename(MilitarySpend_ShareofGDP=value)

```

### Joining of the Different Tabs

Here we do a full join to maintain data from all the different tabs. The years when share of Gov spend are unavailable will then show NA as intended.

```{r}
MilitarySpend<- full_join(Cleaned_currentUSD,Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend,by=c("Country","Year","Region"))
MilitarySpend <- full_join(MilitarySpend,Cleaned_ShareOfGDP,by=c("Country","Year","Region"))

head(MilitarySpend)

```

# Descriptive stats

## Pivoting

Mean, Median and Standard Deviation for each of the tabs.

First I wanted to get an idea of what my data looks like for each of the
countries individually. In order to see this I grouped on country name
and the types of data we have.

In order to get that done I need to pivot my data again.

```{r}
combinedData <-MilitarySpend %>%
  pivot_longer(c(MilitarySpend_currentUSD,MilitarySpend_ShareofGovSpend,MilitarySpend_ShareofGDP),names_to = "viewOfSpend",values_to = "Spend")
head(combinedData)

combinedData<-na.omit(combinedData)

```

Total number of countries analyzed:

```{r echo=FALSE}
totNumCountries<-combinedData%>%
  distinct(Country)%>%
  count()
```
List of Countries:
```{r echo=FALSE}
ListOfCountries<-combinedData%>%
  distinct(Country,Region)%>%
  arrange(Country)
```


Number of countries by region:
```{r echo=FALSE}
NumCountriesByRegion<-combinedData%>%
  group_by(Region)%>%
  summarise(numberCountries = n_distinct(Country))%>%
  arrange(desc(numberCountries))

```

## Statistics by region
Now that I have all of my data in a malleable state I will do some initial statistics on each tab of the initial dataset to give asome insight to what patterns or outliers may exist.


### MilitarySpend_currentUSD

I will be using the current USD data for my analysis of major world events so I will not dive deeper at this point.

```{r}
byRegionStats_USD<-combinedData%>%
  group_by(Region,viewOfSpend)%>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Spend, na.rm=TRUE,sigfig=1),
            std = sd(Spend, na.rm=TRUE),
            min = min(Spend, na.rm=TRUE),
            max = max(Spend, na.rm=TRUE))%>%
  arrange(desc(mean))%>%
  filter(viewOfSpend=="MilitarySpend_currentUSD")

byRegionStats_USD

```

### MilitarySpend_ShareOfGDP

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
byRegionStats_GDP<-combinedData%>%
  group_by(Region,viewOfSpend)%>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Spend, na.rm=TRUE,sigfig=1),
            std = sd(Spend, na.rm=TRUE),
            min = min(Spend, na.rm=TRUE),
            max = max(Spend, na.rm=TRUE))%>%
  arrange(desc(mean))%>%
  filter(viewOfSpend=="MilitarySpend_ShareofGDP")

byRegionStats_GDP

```

After sorting by mean share of GDP spend I see that the middle east has the highest by quite a large margin. This is odd because usally the US(North America), has the highest military spending. A max of 1.17 for GDP is also stageringly high when compared to the other regions. This prompts further investigation. A violin plot below gives a visualization of this distribution.


```{r}
byRegionStats_GDP<-combinedData%>%
  group_by(Region,viewOfSpend,Year)%>%
  filter(viewOfSpend=="MilitarySpend_ShareofGDP")


byRegionStats_GDP$Region<-as.factor(byRegionStats_GDP$Region)

violin_gdp<- na.omit(byRegionStats_GDP)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Region,y=Spend))+
  geom_violin()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1))

violin_gdp

# removing NAs here because I cant plot them, I dont want to replace them with other values because it is still of interest when countries do not display their data.

```

Upon investigation of the underlying data I see that Kuwait in 1991 is the culprit of the high military spending as percent of GDP number.

```{r}
byRegionStats_GDP%>%
  filter(Region=="Middle East")%>%
  arrange(desc(Spend))%>%
  head()
```

I initially thought this was a typo since there were two 1s in a row and
it was such an insanely high spend. A share of GDP of 1.173 means Kuwait
spent 117.3% of their GDP in that year. Upon further investigation, this
is actually true and it was driven by the Persian Gulf War(aka Gulf
War). The Gulf War was a conflict triggered by Iraqs invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. This invasion was the first major international crisis since
the Cold War and will certainly be a topic I add to the final analysis.

https://www.britannica.com/event/Persian-Gulf-War

Loosely I will plot Iraq, US and Kuwait spend from 1985-1995 to explore
this time period.

```{r warning=FALSE}
combinedData%>%
  filter(Year >= 1985 & Year<= 1995)%>%
  filter(Country %in% c("United States of America","Iraq","Kuwait"))%>%
    ggplot(mapping=aes(y = Spend, x = Year))+  
    geom_line(aes(color = Country),na.rm = FALSE)+
    facet_wrap(vars(`viewOfSpend`),scales = "free_y")
```

A new discovery! Iraq chose not to report their spending during the Gulf
war. This is most likely due to the fact that SIPRI data collection is funded by the Swedish government who have pretty close ties to the United States. Sweden was one of the first countries to recognize US independence in 1783. Below I highlight reported Iraqi military spending overlaid with markings for the start and end of their reported data. We can see that in the time leading up to the gulf war military spending rose sharpley and even after the war they continued to spend above historical levels.

```{r warning=FALSE}
startOfNoData<- 1982
endofNoData<- 2003

iraqMissingDataPLOT<-combinedData%>%
  filter(Country %in% c("Iraq"))%>%
    ggplot(mapping=aes( x = Spend,y = Year))+
    geom_point()+
    facet_wrap(vars(`viewOfSpend`),scales = "free_x")+
    scale_y_continuous(labels=seq(1949,2020,5),breaks =seq(1949,2020,5))

iraqMissingDataPLOT+
geom_hline(yintercept = 1982,color="red")+
geom_hline(yintercept = 2003,color="red")+
geom_hline(yintercept = 1985,color="blue")+
geom_hline(yintercept = 1995,color="blue")+

annotate("text",x=0,y=1995,label="End of Gulf war",hjust=-0.1,vjust=-0.1,color="blue")

```

### MilitarySpend_ShareofGovSpend

```{r}
byRegionStats_GovSpend<-combinedData%>%
  group_by(Region,viewOfSpend)%>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Spend, na.rm=TRUE,sigfig=1),
            std = sd(Spend, na.rm=TRUE),
            min = min(Spend, na.rm=TRUE),
            max = max(Spend, na.rm=TRUE))%>%
  arrange(desc(mean))%>%
  filter(viewOfSpend=="MilitarySpend_ShareofGovSpend")

byRegionStats_GovSpend
```
The share of Gov spend shows an insanely high max of sub-Saharan African spending as well as the Middle East.The Middle east spending has been explained above however below I will investigate the sub-sahara African spending.

```{r}
violin_ShareOfSpend<- na.omit(byRegionStats_GovSpend)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Region,y=Spend))+
  geom_violin()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1))

violin_gdp
```


Zooming into Zimbabwe's Violin plot we can see that they often have an exteremly high military spending when compared to overall spending. As suggested by [5], Zimbabwe's military spending is highly influenced by internal political turbulence more so than economic factors. It should also be mentioned that their military spending is often determined by SIPRI from estimation and not necessarily accurate, for this reason I wont be looking further into the anomaly.

```{r}
combinedData%>%
  filter(viewOfSpend=="MilitarySpend_ShareofGovSpend")%>%
  filter(Region == "sub-Saharan Africa")%>%
  filter(Country=="Zimbabwe")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Country,y=Spend))+
  geom_violin()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1))

```

Now that some introductory statistics have been done to explain the data at first glance, we focus in on the heavy hitters in the military spending space and look into how recent global events have affected their spending habits.


Top 6 mean spenders
```{r}
top6_mean <- byRegionStats_USD %>%
  head()%>%
  pull(Region)

top6_mean
```



The top 6 spenders stand out not only in their mean spending habits but they continue to spend more and more.
```{r}

statsViz2<- byRegionStats_USD%>%
  mutate(test = fct_reorder(Region,desc(mean)))%>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(y = test, x = mean))+  
  geom_point(aes(color = Region, alpha=0.9, size=max)) +
  guides(alpha="none",color="none") +
  labs(title = "Certain Regions on average spend more than others" ,caption = "Data from SPIRI Military Expediture Database")

statsViz2
```

### Top 6 spenders over time
This data is scaled for each country on the Y axis so that you can see the shape of the spending compared to global averages. I found the below interesting in that it paints the story of the US setting the pace and overall shape of the graph with East Asia playing a bit of catchup, mostly driven by China.

```{r warning=FALSE}
byRegionStats_year_top6<-combinedData%>%
  group_by(Region,viewOfSpend,Year)%>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Spend, na.rm=TRUE))%>%
  filter(viewOfSpend == 'MilitarySpend_currentUSD')%>%
  filter(Region == top6_mean)%>%
  arrange(desc(mean))


# add global average overlay
GlobalAverage<-combinedData%>%
  group_by(viewOfSpend,Year)%>%
  filter(viewOfSpend=="MilitarySpend_currentUSD")%>%
  summarise(GlobalAverage = mean(Spend),GlobalStandardDev = sd(Spend))

byRegionplot_top6<- byRegionStats_year_top6%>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x = Year, y = mean))+
  geom_line(aes(color = Region)) +
  geom_line(data= GlobalAverage,aes(x=Year,y=GlobalAverage))+
  facet_wrap(vars(`Region`),scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Raw Mean Spend in USD for top 6 Spenders with Global Average Overlay" ,caption = "Data from SPIRI Military Expediture Database")


byRegionplot_top6

```

### Top 6 spenders over time with GDP raw value overlay

In order to show the raw values of military spend and GDP for the top 6 spenders I back calculate the true GDP spend values from the percentage of military spend. This gives an idea of how the relationship of money spent on military causes and domestic production is shaped. We can see that for the most part raw GDP spend increases steadily, while we see more dramatic swings in military spending. An interesting point of note however is the increase in military spending in Eastern Europe and the Middle East associated with a dip in the regions GDP. If I were to continue to expand the report this would be an area of investigation. 

```{r warning=FALSE}
byRegionStats_year_top6_GDP<-combinedData%>%
  filter(Region %in% top6_mean)%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = viewOfSpend,values_from = Spend)%>%
  mutate(rawGDP = `MilitarySpend_currentUSD`/`MilitarySpend_ShareofGDP`)%>%
  group_by(Region,Year)%>%
  summarize(meanUSD = mean(MilitarySpend_currentUSD, na.rm=TRUE), meanGDP =mean(rawGDP,na.rm=TRUE))
  
  

byRegionplot_top6_GDP<- byRegionStats_year_top6%>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x = Year, y = mean))+
  geom_line(aes(color = Region)) +
  geom_line(data= byRegionStats_year_top6_GDP,aes(x=Year,y=meanGDP))+
  facet_wrap(vars(`Region`),scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Raw Mean Spend in USD for top 6 Spenders with raw GDP Overlay" ,caption = "Data from SPIRI Military Expediture Database")

```


### Top and bottom 5 spenders

```{r}
topMean<-combinedData%>%
  group_by(Country,Region,viewOfSpend)%>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Spend, na.rm=TRUE,sigfig=1),
            std = sd(Spend, na.rm=TRUE))%>%
  filter(mean>=1880)%>%
  arrange(desc(mean))

  filter(mean>=1880)%>%
  arrange(mean)



combinedData%>%
  filter(Country == "Afghanistan")%>%
  na.omit()%>%
  mean(Spend)

```

Top 5 spenders on average:

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(topMean)
```

Bottom 5 spenders on average:

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(botMean)
```

## Top spenders by Country

In the following analysis I will be looking at significant events which
impacted some if not all of the world. For the sake of clarity I will
only be focusing on a select group of individual countries which are
not directly involved. The top 10 countries which stand out as
significant spenders in the last 10 years will be the ones focused on.

```{r}

Plots detailing YoY(Year over Year) spending for each of the top 10 spenders. Green and green line segments indicate that year having an increase or decrease in spending respectively. From this visualization we can see more often than not the spending of most nations is increasing. Germany, France, Japan, and the UK stand out as those who do the most jumping back and forth between spending more or less YoY.

# 9/11 analysis

The first major global event I want to intentionally focus in on is the September 11th, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center in New York City. This terrorist attack on the United States left the world stunned and had lasting effects on global military spending.

```

It looks like the event of 9/11 had a pretty significant impact on US
spending. While initially it looks like spending just continues to rise
when looking at the raw USD spending, it is refreshing to see the share
of Gov spend has trended down in recent years as money is being spent
elsewhere. Another interesting observation is that there was a slight
upward trend in spending prior to the attack in 2001 however the
spending increase was mostly reactionary.

```{r}

# Ukraine war analysis
Due to the recency of the Russo-Ukrainian War I will only be able to provide an analysis of the time period building up to the invasion of Ukraine. In order to get an idea of if and how different regions, and their respective countries, prepared for the invasion I overlay the top 10 spenders with key dates.

```{r}
top10CountriesUkraineWar<- top10SpendCountriesbyYear%>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x = Year, y = Spend))+  
  geom_point(aes(color = Country, alpha=0.9)) +
  theme_light() +

  labs(title = "How Top 10 spending Nations prepared for 2022 invasion of Ukraine" ,caption = "Data from SPIRI Military Expediture Database")

  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1),legend.position = "None")+
  coord_cartesian((xlim=c(2010,2020)))



```

From the above we can somewhat see a trend in increased spending from the top 10 spenders. Next we investigate the Nations geographically surrounding Russia. Upon Putin's first election, spending grew and then come his re-election spending increased at an expedited rate in Central and Eastern Europe.

```{r}

Dwight D. Eisenhower

After reviewing the data at a high level and diving deeper into spending surrounding 9/11 and the Russo-Ukraine war I have found a few facts have held true through the years. Powerful country Military spending rises like ships in high tide, when one goes up, they all do. In the years leading up to an altercation the nations involved often increased spending both in raw USD as well as percentage of their government spend and GDP. In the future I would like to spend some more time analyzing the tabs other than USD spend and look a little bit more at the times of peace and how countries would prioritize spending that time period. I had a lot of fun with this project and can say now that I am competent with R even when starting with zero experience beforehand.

## Cleaning with intermitant steps
# Input and Cleaning

## Reading in raw information

The data provided by the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute(SIPRI) was separated into multiple tabs in one excel .xlsx
file.

In order to begin working I imported the tabs I planned to utilize,
skipping over some of the notes and title rows at the start of each tab.

```{r}
rawData_CurrentUSD <- read_excel("_data/SIPRI-Milex-data-1949-2021.xlsx",sheet=sheets[6],skip=5)
rawData_ShareOfGDP <- read_excel("_data/SIPRI-Milex-data-1949-2021.xlsx",sheet=sheets[7],skip=5)
rawData_ShareOfGovSpend <- read_excel("_data/SIPRI-Milex-data-1949-2021.xlsx",sheet=sheets[9],skip=7)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# output
head(rawData_CurrentUSD)
#head(rawData_ShareOfGDP)
#head(rawData_ShareOfGovSpend)
```

Next I delete the first row of NA as well as the Notes column for each
tibble.

```{r}
rawData_CurrentUSD <- rawData_CurrentUSD[-1,]  %>%
  select(-Notes)
rawData_ShareOfGDP <- rawData_ShareOfGDP[-1,] %>%
  select(-Notes)
rawData_ShareOfGovSpend <- rawData_ShareOfGovSpend[-1,] %>%
  select(-2:-3)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(rawData_CurrentUSD)
#head(rawData_ShareOfGDP)
#head(rawData_ShareOfGovSpend)  
```

## Tidying Data

Before pivoting my data I wanted to add a column for region. I chose to
do this with an algorithm as an exercise in iteration however it would
have been more practical to just hard code this column.

The list of countries where there are NA's for every year:

```{r}
Regions <- rawData_CurrentUSD %>%
  filter(is.na(`1949`))%>%
  select(Country)

Regions
```

You will notice that some of these are continents and sub-continents, I
wanted to break these into a `Region` field. The pattern I saw and chose
to exploit was the fact that the overarching category would always be
followed with a more specific category such as the **Africa** followed
by **North Africa** values (see earlier print outs to see raw
information).

I then added an empty vector into the tibble and populated it according
to the Country column using the pattern described above.

Once I had left flags in the region column dictating where each region
was starting I could use `fill(Region)` in order to populate the rest of
the column.

```{r}
emptyRegionCol <- as.numeric(vector(mode = "character",length = length(rawData_CurrentUSD$`1949`)))## doing as numeric here as a hacky way to fill this with NA's, any better way?

#adding col to tibble to be populated later
mutated_CurrentUSD <- rawData_CurrentUSD %>%
  mutate(Region =emptyRegionCol,.before=2)

# replacing the empty char in region with actual region if 2 NAs appear in a row
  #iterates along the indices of the Country vector
for(i in seq_along(mutated_CurrentUSD$Country) ){
   #if 2 nas in a row then do something
  if(is.na(mutated_CurrentUSD$`1949`[i]) && is.na(mutated_CurrentUSD$`1949`[i+1]) ){
    mutated_CurrentUSD$Region[i+1] <- mutated_CurrentUSD$Country[i+1] #this works because when referencing an index outside of the vector R will return NA - Great to know.
  }
  #if the row is a region
  if(is.na(mutated_CurrentUSD$`1949`[i]) ){
     mutated_CurrentUSD$Region[i+1] <- mutated_CurrentUSD$Country[i]
  }
}

mutated_CurrentUSD <- mutated_CurrentUSD %>%
  fill(Region)

head(mutated_CurrentUSD)
```

Now that I had my proof of concept for cleaning one of the sheets, in a
format I wanted, it was time to clean the other sheets as well. I could
have taken the above code and modified it to work for each of the
other tabs individually however I took the opportunity to practice with
functions and created the below function to clean any of the tabs once
they were loaded in and lightly pre-processed.

## Clean and format function

```{r}
## creating a function to clean the other sheets
##Input: a partially cleaned tibble, must have been read in and had excess rows trimmed
##output: tibble with regions correctly labeled and umbrella region categories i.e Africa above south Africa removed
##Note: All sub categories contained the main category name in them, will use regex to create groupings in the future.
CleanData <- function(inSheet){
  emptyRegionCol <- as.numeric(vector(mode = "character",length = nrow(select(inSheet,2))))

  #adding col to tibble to be populated later
  output <- inSheet %>%
    mutate(Region = emptyRegionCol,.before=2)


  # replacing the empty char in region with actual region if 2 NAs appear in a row
    #iterates along the indices of the Country vector
  for(i in seq_along(output$Country)){
  
    if(is.na(output[[i,3]]) && is.na(output[[(i+1),3]]))
      output$Region[i+1] <- output$Country[i+1]
    
    if(is.na(output[[i,3]]))
       output$Region[i+1] <- output$Country[i]
  }
  
  output <- output %>%
    fill(Region)
  
  
  # removing header rows
  output <- output %>%
    filter(!is.na(output[[3]]))
}

```

Below I call the function on each of the tibbles loaded in earlier. For
the sake of space I will only show one tab being cleaned.

Before:

```{r echo=FALSE}
#head(rawData_CurrentUSD)
#head(rawData_ShareOfGDP)
head(rawData_ShareOfGovSpend)
```

```{r}
Cleaned_currentUSD <- CleanData(rawData_CurrentUSD)
Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend <- CleanData(rawData_ShareOfGovSpend)
Cleaned_ShareOfGDP <- CleanData(rawData_ShareOfGDP)
```

After:
```{r echo=FALSE}
#head(Cleaned_currentUSD)
#head(Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend)
head(Cleaned_ShareOfGDP)

```

## Pivoting and Restructuring

### Pivot and Notation Changes

Next I pivot the years, it should be noted that both the pivoting and
Converting of notation could be handled by the clean function above, i
kept the steps separate so that I could show the progression of the
dataframe.

I must also handle the xxx and ... notations. From the information page
of my data set I can see that the notation is described as follows:

| Raw Notation | Meaning                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| ...          | Data unavailable                                                                        |
| xxx          | Country did not exist or was not independent during all or part of the year in question |

For now I think I will just keep both as NA but will save this form of
the information for future use.

After pivot and notation changes:

```{r}
Cleaned_currentUSD <- Cleaned_currentUSD %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=3:ncol(Cleaned_currentUSD),names_to = "Year",values_drop_na = FALSE)%>%
    na_if("...") %>%
      na_if("xxx")
  
Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend <- Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=3:ncol(Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend),names_to = "Year",values_drop_na = FALSE)%>%
    na_if("...") %>%
      na_if("xxx")

Cleaned_ShareOfGDP <- Cleaned_ShareOfGDP %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=3:ncol(Cleaned_ShareOfGDP),names_to = "Year",values_drop_na = FALSE)%>%
    na_if("...") %>%
      na_if("xxx")


df1<-head(Cleaned_currentUSD)
df2<-head(Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend)
df3<-head(Cleaned_ShareOfGDP)


#df1
#df2
# share of GDP
df3


```

### Converting Column Types

Finally I will convert the column types to their correct representation.

Before:

```{r echo=FALSE}
#head(Cleaned_currentUSD)
#head(Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend)
head(Cleaned_ShareOfGDP)

```

```{r}
#Year to Number
Cleaned_currentUSD$Year<-as.integer(Cleaned_currentUSD$Year)
Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend$Year<-as.integer(Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend$Year)
Cleaned_ShareOfGDP$Year<-as.integer(Cleaned_ShareOfGDP$Year)

# value to double
Cleaned_currentUSD$value <- as.numeric(Cleaned_currentUSD$value)
Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend$value<- as.numeric(Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend$value)
Cleaned_ShareOfGDP$value<- as.numeric(Cleaned_ShareOfGDP$value)
```

After:

```{r echo=FALSE}
#head(Cleaned_currentUSD)
#head(Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend)
head(Cleaned_ShareOfGDP)
```






```{r echo=FALSE}
Cleaned_currentUSD <- Cleaned_currentUSD %>%
  rename(MilitarySpend_currentUSD=value)

Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend <- Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend%>%
  rename(MilitarySpend_ShareofGovSpend=value)

Cleaned_ShareOfGDP <- Cleaned_ShareOfGDP%>%
  rename(MilitarySpend_ShareofGDP=value)

```

### Joining of the Different Tabs

Here we do a full join to maintain data from all the different tabs. The years when share of Gov spend are unavaiable will then show NA as intended.

```{r}
#nrow(Cleaned_currentUSD)
#nrow(Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend)
#nrow(Cleaned_ShareOfGDP)

MilitarySpend<- full_join(Cleaned_currentUSD,Cleaned_ShareOfGovSpend,by=c("Country","Year","Region"))

MilitarySpend <- full_join(MilitarySpend,Cleaned_ShareOfGDP,by=c("Country","Year","Region"))



head(MilitarySpend)
#nrow(MilitarySpend)
```


## extra Vizualizations
