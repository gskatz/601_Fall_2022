## Education/Work Background
I graduated from Waseda University (in Tokyo) with a major in business administration and a minor in Japanese language education.
I worked for a  marketing research company where I first became interested in analyzing human behavior data!

## R experience
I took a course in Business Analytics using R a few years ago.

## Research interests
How people's attitudes toward new ideas change (and how such changes are transmitted)
Human behavior on digital platforms

## Hometown
Tokyo.
I consider Mexico City (where I currently live and work) as my second hometown!

## Hobbies
I play the ukulele and the clarinet!

## Fun fact
I like movies and dramas so much that I became a part-time actor (mostly extra though!) because I want to be in movies myself.
