## Education/Work Background

MS in Computer Science at UMass Amherst, expected graduation in May 2023. Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science from University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, India, graduated in 2021.

## R experience

This course will be my first experience with R!

## Hometown

Dehradun, a valley much like Pioneer Valley, situated in North India.

## Hobbies

I like hiking, and reading books.

## Fun fact

I maintain a biweekly log for all my groceries, meals, and recipes to ensure no produce spoils and I don't have to worry about what to cook for my next meal - cooking all by yourself can be hard!
