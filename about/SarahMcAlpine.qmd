## Education/Work Background

I have been working in higher ed fundraising for 8 years; I am a project manager, storyteller, solver, and the database and operations backbone of my department. Most of my educational background is in the humanities, but I am eager to add more technical skills.

## R experience

This is my first time using R! I have been building SQL queries for several years, using design mode. I'm hoping that gives me an advantage in formulating the logical relationships between tables of data.

## Research interests

I may use some anonymized data from work about alumni and donor engagement, and I'm also interested in ecological studies about native plants in New England--and I'm always curious and open to new fields of study!

## Hometown

Easthampton, MA

## Hobbies

Native plant and meadow gardening, reading, journaling, pottery, meditation.

## Fun fact

I enrolled in this certificate program very suddenly during the first week of class after years of considering it.
