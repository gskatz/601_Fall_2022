## Education/Work Background

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Sociology from Clark University, as well as my Master of Public Administration. I've worked at UMass Chan Medical School as a research coordinator for the past 2 years on projects improving education and employment access and outcomes for young adults with mental health conditions and other disabilities.

## R experience

I have no experience with R (or any coding).

## Research interests

I'm interested in community-engaged public health research focusing on mental health trauma,and health equity for BIPOC and LGBTQ+ individuals.

## Hometown

Northampton, MA

## Hobbies

I like to do puzzles, read, volunteer for a local youth-serving nonprofit, and try to befriend dogs.

## Fun fact

During undergrad I withdrew from a Computer Science 101 course on the first day of class because I couldn't download the necessary software on my finicky old laptop.
