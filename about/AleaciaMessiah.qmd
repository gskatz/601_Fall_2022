## Education/Work Background
I received a B.A. in Mathematics and Minor in Drama from St. Mary's University in May 2020. I was enrolled in a Statistics Ph.D. program at the University of California - Davis shortly after but left due to personal reasons and the pandemic. I became a Palace Acquire (PAQ) intern for the Air Force as a budget analyst and have been in the internship since March 2021. 

## R experience
I learned a little bit of R in college (through using R Commander) but did not learn in depth until I entered the Statistics Ph.D. program. However, I did not learn past the beginner level before leaving the program, so I'm hoping to brush up on my R skills.

## Research interests
I haven't narrowed down my research interests yet but I am interested in educational assessment (from my undergraduate research), statistics, time series analysis, and data visualization and communication.

## Hometown
I live in San Antonio, Texas, although I was born in Davenport, Iowa. 

## Hobbies
I enjoy streaming animated shows on Netflix and Hulu, listening to music, and playing with my dog Milo and guinea pig Nutmeg. 

## Fun fact
I can play the oboe, piano, and keyboard percussion from the several years I was in band from elementary school to college.
