  ## Education/Work Background
  B.A. in Psychology, Minor in Education, & specialization in Developmental Disabilities and Human Services (DDHS) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (class of 2021)
Currently working as a data management assistant at an education company

## R experience
I learned R during my second year in undergrad in my PSYCH 240 course

## Research interests
My research interests are mostly psychology & education related, particularly related to marginalized populations. My undergraduate honors thesis published in the UMass Libraries was on teachers' and immigrant parents of children with disabilities perspectives on culturally responsive special education.

## Hometown
I was born in Boston, MA, raised in Sandwich, MA, and now living in Palisades Park, NJ

## Hobbies
My hobbies include hiking (especially with my family dog), reading, gaming, dancing, and spending time with loved ones

## Fun fact
My family dog's name is Ruby, and she is the joy of my life. She is a six year old black German Shepherd. She joined our family when I was sixteen years old, and we have had many adventures together!
