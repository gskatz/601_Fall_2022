## Education/Work Background
I have a B.A. in Classical Guitar Performance from Virginia Commonwealth University, and a B.S. in Geology and an M.S. in Sustainability Sciences from UMass. I currently work as the Water Quality Monitoring Coordinator at the Connecticut River Conservancy. Our headquarters are in Greenfield, but my work takes me all over Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.

## R experience
I worked my way through the swirl tutorial a couple years ago in RStudio, but that ended there. It wasn't quite enough to get me out of Excel and into R.

## Research interests
Most of the data I work with has to do with water quality. However, as it is a nonprofit, sometimes we need to do some analysis on donor behavior.


## Hometown
I grew up half in California and half in Virginia, but I'm now happy to call Heath, Massachusetts, my hometown.


## Hobbies
In my free time, I like to make music, play video games, and crochet. I play guitar, bass, irish tenor banjo, and sing. My favorite thing to crochet is hats. My favorite video games are Stardew Valley and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.

## Fun fact
My husband and I raise chickens (even though I'm allergic to eggs!)
