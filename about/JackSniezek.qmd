## Education/Work Background
Graduated from Siena College in 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Economics and Information Systems minor

I am currently working at Regeneron as a Supply Chain Coordinator. This is located in Rensselaer, which is somewhere I was hoping to end up because I love the area and most of my friends from school live and work there too. I just landed this job after over a year of working a bunch of filler jobs and tons of applications and interviews.

## R experience
I learned R in a business statistics class during my sophomore year at Siena. We learned how to upload and analyze data. I remember running regressions, t tests, chi squared tests and many other data analysis tests. I do not remember a lot that I learned, as it was 4 years ago. However, I am excited to get back into it and expanded my knowledge!

## Research interests
I am interested in researching sports statistics.

## Hometown
Adams, MA

## Hobbies
Playing golf, fishing, video games, hanging out with my friends, watching/playing sports

## Fun fact
I drive a red Jeep that we call "Cherry Pie"
