## Education/Work Background
I graduated with a B.A. in Psychology and completed significant coursework in music from CSU, Stanislaus. In the last 10+ years I have worked in education, as a freelance musician, and in social services. As a young undergrad, I had the opportunity to work for a non-profit that conducted independent program evaluation and applied social research. In this role, I had the opportunity to work in the many different phases of research, including planning, data collection, data cleaning/analysis, and report writing. It was certainly a formative experience to have worked in the scope of applied social research at a young age. Today, I am excited to return to research and am looking forward to learning new skills. 

## R experience
I have no experience working with R, unfortunately. When I went to college and when I worked as a community researcher, we specifically used SPSS for data analysis. Furthermore, I have no coding experience except for my minimal coding knowledge from the MySpace days, back when everyone seemed to have an incentive to code if it meant decking out their MySpace profile. Otherwise, I am as green as they get!

## Research interests
Mental health, health data science, socioeconomic disparities

## Hometown
Lodi, California 

## Hobbies
Playing with my dogs, traveling to new places, playing music, and eating good food. 

## Fun fact
I do not think this is a feat - I think everyone can do this on some level - but Iâ€™ve been told it is unique in that I can accurately recognize people (e.g. friends, family, singers, comedians, actors) without much context, just by the sound of their voice.
