## Education/Work Background
 - I graduated in 2006 with a Bachelors degree in Mathematics and Philosophy from
 the University of Scranton
 - I attended graduate school for Discrete Mathematics and worked for 3 years in the Mathematics and Computer Science department at Goethe Universitaet in Frankfurt, Germany serving as a teaching assistant for various Math courses as well as "Math for Computer Science" courses.
 - For the last 10 years I have been working as a Mathematics and Computer Science teacher at Rising Tide Charter Public School in Plymouth, MA.
 

## R experience
None, that is why I am excited for this course.

## Research interests
I want to analyze the performance of the STEM students at my school. 
I am interested in the use of analytics to support the creation of apolitcal, evidence-based, systems to support STEM teaching and learning at my school.

## Hometown
Elizabethtown, PA

## Hobbies
Yoga, Hiking, Running, Swimming

## Fun fact
- *Light fun fact*: I am fluent in German. Ich kann fliessend Deutsch sprechen.
- *Deep fun fact*: I was always confident as a mathematician and mathematics student but presumed myself to not be "good enough" to learn about computers. I took a CS course in my undergraduate career because it was required of me. As a student of Discrete Mathematics, I was exposed to a lot of computational thinking principals but STILL was afraid to learn to code. Throughout my entire career as a teacher I have had to step up and teach Computer Science because I was the only person willing to do it. Now as I look back on a decade of highly talented female math students who demonstrate the same fears that I too carried, I have for the first time elected to take a computational course by signing up for this class. I didn't "have to" take this course, I "chose to" and I want to develop the skills to analyze and support all students in STEM at my school.
