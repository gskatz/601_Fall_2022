## Education/Work Background
My background is in qualitative research - I have a BAH in Sociology as well as a Bachelor of Physical and Health Education (specializing in cultural studies and sociology of sport) as well as an MA in sociocultural studies of sport and leisure. 

After spending the first 10ish years of my career in non-profit sport management, I made the decision to refocus myself on communications, research, and analysis work. I worked on campus in marketing and communications before moving to my current role as a social media data analyst for a higher ed adjacent agency. 

## R experience

None. Looking to gain some new tools/insight that hopefully help me broaden my research and analysis capabilities!

## Research interests

Cultural studies, higher education, social justice

## Hometown

Toronto, Ontario, Canada

## Hobbies

Hockey, hiking, canoe tripping, powerlifting, writing

## Fun fact

Why is this always the most difficult question to answer? I don't know if it's fun, but I guess it's a fact; I default to Canadian english, so I have to make sure I edit all work school/work writing to make sure I've eliminated all the extraneous "u"s.
